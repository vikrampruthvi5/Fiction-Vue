Who was the man who was rumored to have been kept in prison and treated royally during much of the reign of Louis XIV while being forced to wear an iron mask? Could he possibly have been the twin brother of the Sun King? Like every other serious scholar, intrepid historian Paul Sonnino discounts this theory, instead taking the reader along on his adventures to uncover the truth behind this ancient enigma. Exploring the hidden, squalid side of the lavish court of France, the author uncovers the full spectrum of French society, from humble servants to wealthy merchants to kings and queens. All had self-interested reasons to hold their secrets close until one humble valet named Eustache Dauger was arrested and jailed for decades, simply because he knew too much and opened his mouth at the wrong time. Presenting his dramatic solution to the mystery, Sonnino convincingly shows that no one will be able to tell the story of the man in the iron mask without taking into account the staggering array of evidence he has uncovered over the course of decades."}, {"id": "10743", "title": "Moonfleet", "genre": "Adventure", "language": "en", "author": "J Meade Falkner", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uAV-AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10743/10743-h/10743-h.htm", "desc": "Moonfleet is a tale of smuggling by the English novelist J.

It gets its name from a formerly prominent local family, the Mohunes, whose coat of arms includes a symbol shaped like a capital 'Y'. John Trenchard is an orphan who lives with his aunt, Miss Arnold. Other notable residents are the sexton Mr Ratsey who is friendly to John, Parson Glennie, the local clergyman who also teaches in the village school, Elzevir Block, the landlord of the local inn, called the Mohune Arms but nicknamed the Why Not? because of its sign with the Mohune 'Y', and Mr Maskew, the unpopular local magistrate and his beautiful daughter, Grace. Village legend tells of the notorious Colonel John \"Blackbeard\" Mohune who is buried in the family crypt under the church. He is reputed to have stolen a diamond from King Charles I and hidden it. His ghost is said to wander at night looking for it and the mysterious lights in the churchyard are attributed to his activities. As the main part of the story opens, Block's youthful son, David, has just been killed by Maskew during an attack by the authorities on a smuggling boat. One night a bad storm hits the village and there is a flood. While attending the Sunday service at church, John hears strange sounds from the crypt below. He thinks it is the sound of the coffins of the Mohune family. The next day, he finds Elzevir and Ratsey against the south wall of the church. They claim to be checking for damage from the storm, but John suspects they are searching for Blackbeard's ghost. Later John finds a large sinkhole has opened in the ground by a grave. He follows the passage and finds himself in the crypt with coffins on shelves and casks on the floor. He realises his friends are smugglers and this is their hiding place. He has to hide behind a coffin when he hears Ratsey and Elzevir coming. When they leave, they fill in the hole, inadvertently trapping him."}, {"id": "2727", "title": "Allans Wife", "genre": "Adventure", "language": "en", "author": "Henry Rider Haggard", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FCE1AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2727/2727-h/2727-h.htm", "desc": "The tale of Allan Quatermain's second wife, Stella, is a classic fantasy African adventure, complete with magic and ghosts, plus Haggard's trademark gripping narrative style."}, {"id": "5746", "title": "The Ancient Allan", "genre": "Adventure", "language": "en", "author": "Henry Rider Haggard", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PpQ9AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5746/5746-h/5746-h.htm", "desc": "The Ancient Allan, a sequel to Haggard's The Ivory Child, tells the story of Allan Quatermain's vision of a past life where he was an Egyptian named Shabaka."}, {"id": "3155", "title": "She", "genre": "Adventure", "language": "en", "author": "Tanya Markul", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pcuXDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3155/3155-h/3155-h.htm", "desc": "Crafting together the power of words and womanhood, writer Tanya Markul has written a completely unique poetry collection fit for the phenomenal readers of today.

No ordinary woman, Red Knot was the heir to the Greenstone Clan and the future leader of the independent villages. Her death has shattered all alliances and left a power void that several ambitious clan chiefs see as their destiny to fill.

Feared as a sorcerer, The Panther is the only one with the power to demand to be heard by all.

The water, clear and deep, coming through rocky soil, babbled gently at the edges, where it lapped the land, but in the center the full current flowed steadily and without noise.The thin shadows of early dusk were falling, casting a pallid tint over the world, a tint touched here and there with living fire from the sun, which was gone, though leaving burning embers behind. One glowing shaft, piercing straight through the heavy forest that clothed either bank, fell directly upon the figure in the boat, as a hidden light illuminates a great picture, while the rest is left in shadow. It was no common forest runner who sat in the middle of the red beam. Yet a boy, in nothing but years, he swung the great paddle with an ease and vigor that the strongest man in the West might have envied. His rifle, with the stock carved beautifully, and the long, slender blue barrel of the border, lay by his side. He could bring the paddle into the boat, grasp the rifle, and carry it to his shoulder with a single, continuous movement.His most remarkable aspect, one that the casual observer even would have noticed, was an extraordinary vitality. He created in the minds of those who saw him a feeling that he lived intensely every moment of his life. Born and-bred in the forest, he was essentially its child, a perfect physical being, trained by the utmost hardship and danger, and with every faculty, mental and physical, in complete coordination. It is only by a singular combination of time and place, and only once in millions of chances, that Nature produces such a being.The canoe remained a few moments in the center of the red light, and its occupant, with a slight swaying motion of the paddle, held it steady in the current, while he listened. Every feature stood out in the glow, the firm chin, the straight strong nose, the blue eyes, and the thick yellow hair.

At the age of 16 he went to Canada and was six years in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company. He returned to Scotland in 1847, and published his first book the following year, Hudson's Bay: or, Life in the Wilds of North America. For some time he was employed by Messrs Constable, the publishers, but in 1856 he gave up business for the profession of literature, and began the series of adventure stories for the young with which his name is popularly associated.

In one of the narrow lanes or \"Rows\" peculiar to that town, the skipper of the smack stood at his own door, grumbling. He was a broad burly man, a little past the prime of life, but prematurely aged by hard work and hard living. \"He's always out o' the way when he's wanted, an' always in the way when he's not wanted,\" said the skipper angrily to his wife, of whom he was at the moment taking, as one of his mates remarked, a tender farewell. \"Don't be hard on him, David,\" pleaded the wife, tearfully, as she looked up in her husband's face. \"He's only a bit thoughtless; and I shouldn't wonder if he was already down at the smack.\" \"If he's not,\" returned the fisherman with a frown, as he clenched his huge right hand-and a hard and horny hand it was, from constant grappling with ropes, oars, hand-spikes, and the like-\"if he's not, I'll-\" He stopped abruptly, as he looked down at his wife's eyes, and the frown faded. No wonder, for that wife's eyes were soft and gentle, and her face was fair and very attractive as well as refined in expression, though not particularly pretty. \"Well, old girl, come, I won't be hard on 'im. Now I'm off, -good-day.\" And with that the fisherman stooped to kiss his wife, who returned the salute with interest. At the same time she thrust a packet into his hand.

Notable fiction stories by Ellis include The Steam Man of the Prairies and Seth Jones, or the Captives of the Frontier.Internationally, Edward S. Ellis is probably known best for his Deerfoot novels read widely by young boys until the 1950s.Dime novelsSeth Jones was the most significant of early dime novels of publishers Beadle and Adams. It is said that Seth Jones was one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite stories. During the mid-1880s, after a fiction-writing career of some thirty years, Ellis eventually began composing more serious works of biography, history, and persuasive writing. Of note was \"The Life of Colonel David Crockett,\" which had the story of Davy Crockett giving a speech usually called \"Not Yours To Give.\" It was a speech in opposition to awarding money to a Navy widow on the grounds that Congress had no Constitutional mandate to give charity. It was said to have been inspired by Crockett's meeting with a Horatio Bunce, a much quoted man in Libertarian circles, but one for whom historical evidence is non-existent.PseudonymsBesides the one hundred fifty-nine books published by his own name, Ellis' work was published under various pseudonyms, including: \"James Fenimore Cooper Adams\" or \"Captain Bruin Adams\" (68 titles)\"Boynton M. Belknap\" (9 titles)\"J. G. Bethune\" (1 title)\"Captain Latham C. Carleton\" (2 titles)\"Frank Faulkner\" (1 title)\"Capt. R. M. Hawthorne\" (4 titles)\"Lieut. Ned Hunter\" (5 titles)\"Lieut. R. H.

Randolph\" (8 titles)\"Emerson Rodman\" (10 titles)\"E. A. St. Mox\" (2 titles)\"Seelin Robins\" (19 titles)He was a major author during the era of inexpensive fiction of the nineteenth century (dime novels).

Following the destruction of the Temple, and their defeat in the second century Bar Kokhba revolt, they became a people without a home. Dispersed all over the world, their religion changed from one based on a central authority in Jerusalem, to one which was dependent on the authority of individual community-based rabbis. The destruction of Jerusalem also had a major impact on the development of Christianity. Originally Christianity took two major forms, a Jewish version and one based on the teachings of St. Paul. With the Roman destruction of Judea, and the dispersion of the Jews, the Paulinian form was the only one left standing. One can only speculate what both Christianity and Judaism would look like today if Jerusalem had not been destroyed. In For the Temple, a young Jewish boy is swept up in the events surrounding the Roman invasion. From guerrilla leader, to a defender of Jerusalem, to being a slave in Alexandria, he experiences the horror and frustration of fighting a hopeless war. He soon comes in contact with a Jewish religious group called the Essenes, who lived a reclusive life of severe self-denial. From them he hears of a Jewish teacher who was crucified only a few years earlier, and that story changes his life. The book concludes with three articles in the \"Rest of the Story\" section: I.

It was impossible, in the limits of one book, to give even an outline of the story of the Peninsular War, without devoting the whole space to the military operations. It would, in fact, have been a history rather than a tale; and it accordingly closed with the passage of the Douro, and the expulsion of the French from Portugal.The hero, Terence O'Connor, was the son of the senior captain of the Mayo Fusiliers and, when the regiment was ordered to join Sir Arthur Wellesley's expedition to Portugal, the colonel of the regiment obtained for him a commission; although so notorious was the boy, for his mischievous pranks, that the colonel hesitated whether he would not get into some serious scrapes; especially as Dick Ryan, one of the ensigns, was always his companion in mischief, and both were aided and abetted by Captain O'Grady.However, on the way out, the slow old transport, in which a wing of the regiment was carried, was attacked by two French privateers, who would have either taken or sunk her, had it not been for a happy suggestion of the quick-witted lad. For this he gained great credit, and was selected by General Fane as one of his aides-de-camp. In this capacity he went through the arduous campaign, under General Moore, that ended at Corunna.His father had been so seriously wounded, at Vimiera, that he was invalided home and placed on half pay; and in the same battle Captain O'Grady lost his left arm but, on its being cured, returned to his place in the regiment.At Corunna Terence, while carrying a despatch, was thrown from his horse and stunned; and on recovering found that the British had already embarked on board the ships of the fleet. He made his way to the frontier of Portugal, and thence to Lisbon. He was then appointed to the staff of Sir John Craddock, who was now in command; and sent in charge of some treasure for the use of the Spanish General Romana, who was collecting a force on the northern border of Portugal. Terence had orders to aid him, in any way in his power, to check the invasion of Portugal from the north.Of this order he took advantage when, on the way, the agents of the junta of Oporto endeavoured to rob him; attacking the house where he and his escort had taken up their quarters with a newly-raised levy of two thousand five hundred unarmed peasants. By a ruse he got their leaders into his hands, and these showed such abject cowardice that the peasants refused further to follow them, and asked Terence to take the command of the force.He assented, formed them into two battalions, appointed two British orderlies as majors, the Portuguese officer of his escort lieutenant-colonel, and his troopers captains of companies; put them in the way of obtaining arms and, by dint of hard drill and kindness, converted them into an efficient body of soldiers. Finding that little was to be expected from Romana's force, he acted as a partisan leader and, in this capacity, performed such valuable service that he was confirmed in the command of his force, which received the name of the Minho regiment; and he and his officers received commissions for the rank they held in the Portuguese army."}, {"id": "17766", "title": "With Wolfe in Canada The Winning of a Continent", "genre": "Childrens", "language": "en", "author": "G A Henty", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HWXFDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17766/17766-h/17766-h.htm", "desc": "Set in the mid-eighteenth century, With Wolfe in Canada follows young hero James Walsham as he leaves his native England and travels to Canada to fight alongside famed commander Major General James Wolfe in his campaigns against the French forces in and around Quebec."}, {"id": "8745", "title": "Wulf the Saxon A Story of the Norman Conquest", "genre": "Childrens", "language": "en", "author": "G A Henty", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wNXQDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8745/8745-h/8745-h.htm", "desc": "Although the immediate results of the Battle of Hastings may have been of less importance to the world than were those of some other great battles, the struggle has, in the long run, had a greater influence upon the destiny of mankind than any other similar event that has ever taken place. That admixture of Saxon, Danish, and British races which had come to be known under the general name of English, was in most respects far behind the rest of Europe. The island was, as it had always been,--except during the rule of two or three exceptionally strong kings,--distracted by internal dissensions. Broad lines of division still separated the North from the South, and under weak Kings the powerful Earls became almost independent. The enterprise that had distinguished their Saxon and Danish ancestors seems to have died out. There was a general indisposition to change, and except in her ecclesiastical buildings, England made but little progress in civilization from the time of Alfred to that of Harold. Its insular position cut it off from taking part in that rapid advance which, beginning in Italy, was extending throughout Europe. The arrival, however, of the impetuous Norman race, securing as it did a close connection with the Continent, quickened the intellect of the people, raised their intelligence, was of inestimable benefit to the English, and played a most important part in raising England among the nations. Moreover, it has helped to produce the race that has peopled Northern America, Australia, and the south of Africa, holds possession of India, and stands forth as the greatest civilizer in the world. The Conquest of England by the Normans was achieved without even a shadow of right or justice. It was at the time an unmixed curse to England; but now we can recognize the enormous benefits that accrued when in his turn the Englishman conquered the Norman, and the foreign invaders became an integral portion of the people they had overcome. For the historical details of the story, I have only had to go to Freeman's magnificent History of the Norman Conquest of England, which I hope will be perused by all of my readers who are able to obtain it."}, {"id": "20043", "title": "The Angel Children or Stories from CloudLand", "genre": "Childrens", "language": "en", "author": "Higgins Charlotte M", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7j-SDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20043/20043-h/20043-h.htm", "desc": "Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

They managed to introduce themselves one by one, and presently Mrs. Merriman was seen trotting contentedly down the avenue, followed by her new pupils. She looked something like a well-groomed pony herself, and the girls were much amused at her way of greeting them, and so thoroughly pleased that peals of laughter reached the displeased ears of Lucy, who was waiting with Annie and Laura in the porch.\"Really,\" thought Lucy, \"poor mother gets worse and worse.

I shall be glad when Miss Archer and Mademoiselle Omont come. How are we to spend the present evening?\"The girls themselves seemed to arrange that matter. Having lost all shyness with regard to Mrs. Merriman, they were not likely to feel it towards Lucy. They accordingly requested to be taken into the house, and were much pleased with the arrangements made for their comfort. The old house of Sunnyside was one of the prettiest in the southwest of England. It had spacious grounds, beautiful gardens, and the rooms themselves, although somewhat low, were large and numerous. One or two girls had a room each, and the others were arranged two in a room, with a curtain between.When Mrs. Merriman started the idea of a small school for the special education of special girls, she had spared no expense to have everything done in as thoroughly nice a manner as possible; and the girls themselves were delighted, and showed their appreciation by behaving in a hoydenish and school-girl fashion. They laughed and joked with each other, declaring that Mrs. Merriman was quite too funny for anything, but that she was also an old dear; that Lucy was rather a nuisance, and very prim, but that she shouldn't stand much in their way.

Arthur Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1859.

The Old Man in the Corner contains twelve of the stories by Baroness Orczy featuring the mysterious man who sits in the corner of the ABC tea shop fiddling with a piece of string whilst working our the solutions to crimes that have baffled the police. Each case is unfolded during the course of a conversation between the man in the corner and a lady journalist, an ingenious method that avoids the necessity of a clumsy tacked-on explanation of the crime.

Nor does he have much faith in conventional police methods and crime solving capabilities. _We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature, and has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement\". Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904. Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between its characters and events and those of the poem (the correspondence of Leopold Bloom to Odysseus, Molly Bloom to Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus to Telemachus). Joyce divided Ulysses into 18 chapters or \"episodes\". At first glance much of the book may appear unstructured and chaotic; Joyce once said that he had \"put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant\", which would earn the novel \"immortality\". James Joyce (1882-1941) was an Irish novelist and poet, considered to be one of the most influential writers in the modernist avant-garde of the early 20th century. Joyce is best known for Ulysses, the short-story collection Dubliners, and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Finnegans Wake."}, {"id": "961", "title": "Glinda of Oz\r In Which Are Related the Exciting Experiences of Princess Ozma of Oz and Dorothy in Their Hazardous Journey to the Home of the Flatheads and to the Magic Isle of the Skeezers and How They Were Rescued from Dire Peril by the Sorcery of Glinda the Good", "genre": "Fantasy", "language": "en", "author": "Katharine M Rogers", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kxePw8MEs-oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/961/961-h/961-h.htm", "desc": "Since it was first introduced over a hundred years ago in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, L. Frank Baum's world of Oz has become one of the most enduring and beloved creations in children's literature. It has influenced numerous prominent writers and intellectuals, and become a lasting part of the culture itself. L. Frank Baum was born in 1856 in upstate New York, the seventh child of a very successful barrel-maker and later oil producer. However, Baum's own career path was a rocky one. Beginning as an actor, Baum tried working as a traveling salesman, the editor of a small town newspaper and the publisher of a trade journal on retailing, failing to distinguish himself in any occupation. His careers either failed to provide a sufficient living for his beloved wife Maud and their children or were so exhausting as to be debilitating. In the 1890's, L. Frank Baum took the advice of his mother-in-law, suffragist leader Matilda Gage, and turned his attention to trying to sell the stories he'd been telling to his sons and their friends. After a few children's books published with varying success, he published The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1900 and it quickly became a bestseller and has remained so ever since. In this first full-length adult biography of Baum, Rogers discusses some of the aspects that made his work unique and has likely contributed to Oz's long-lasting appeal, including Baum's early support of feminism and how it was reflected in his characters, his interest in Theosophy and how it took form in his books, and the celebration in his stories of traditional American values. Grounding his imaginative creations, particularly in his fourteen Oz books, in the reality of his day, Katharine M. Rogers explores the fascinating life and influences of America's greatest writer for children."}, {"id": "19467", "title": "Little Wizard Stories of Oz", "genre": "Fantasy", "language": "en", "author": "L Frank Baum", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JKF9CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19467/19467-h/19467-h.htm", "desc": "This book contains the Little Wizard Stories of Oz, a collection of six short stories designed for young children by the writer of the Oz books, L.

So he set forth from Narberth that night, and went as far as Llwyn Diarwyd. And that night he tarried there, and early on the morrow he rose and came to Glyn Cuch; when he let loose the dogs in the wood, and sounded the horn, and began the chace. And as he followed the dogs, he lost his companions; and whilst he listened to the hounds, he heard the cry of other hounds, a cry different from his own, and coming in the opposite direction. And he beheld a glade in the wood forming a level plain, and as his dogs came to the edge of the glade, he saw a stag before the other dogs. And lo, as it reached the middle of the glade, the dogs that followed the stag overtook it, and brought it down. Then looked he at the colour of the dogs, staying not to look at the stag, and of all the hounds that he had seen in the world, he had never seen any that were like unto those. For their hair was of a brilliant shining white, and their ears were red; and as the whiteness of their bodies shone, so did the redness of their ears glisten. And he came towards the dogs, and drove away those that had brought down the stag, and set his own dogs upon it.

With his agile prose, Massey leads an adventurous examination of the epistemology of astronomy, time, and Christology-and what it all means for human culture.

Before that period she had to struggle for her very existence with the English already possessed of her fairest provinces while the utmost exertions of her King, and the gallantry of her people, could scarcely protect the remainder from a foreign yoke. Nor was this her sole danger. The princes who possessed the grand fiefs of the crown, and, in particular, the Dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne, had come to wear their feudal bonds so lightly that they had no scruple in lifting the standard against their liege and sovereign lord, the King of France, on the slightest pretence. When at peace, they reigned as absolute princes in their own provinces; and the House of Burgundy, possessed of the district so called, together with the fairest and richest part of Flanders, was itself so wealthy, and so powerful, as to yield nothing to the crown, either in splendor or in strength. assumed as much independence as his distance from the sovereign power, the extent of his fief, or the strength of his chateau enabled him to maintain; and these petty tyrants, no longer amenable to the exercise of the law, perpetrated with impunity the wildest excesses of fantastic oppression and cruelty... -- Sir Walter Scott"}, {"id": "9756", "title": "Leila or the Siege of Granada Book I", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "BulwerLytton E", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x9KWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/9756/9756-h/9756-h.htm", "desc": "Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803 \u2013 1873) was an English novelist, poet, playwright and politician.

On the same day another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him. All England wanted him too. England had so longed for him, and hoped for him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the people went nearly mad for joy. Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they kept this up for days and nights together. By day, London was a sight to see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and splendid pageants marching along. By night, it was again a sight to see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry around them. There was no talk in all England but of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him-and not caring, either. But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence.

He turned himself this way and that before the great mirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating the prince's high-bred carriage, and still observing results in the glass. Next he drew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing the blade, and laying it across his breast, as he had seen a noble knight do, by way of salute to the lieutenant of the Tower, five or six weeks before, when delivering the great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity. Tom played with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined the costly and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the sumptuous chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court herd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur.

The population of Prussia was not more than five millions, while that of the Allies considerably exceeded a hundred millions. Prussia could put, with the greatest efforts, but a hundred and fifty thousand men into the field, and as these were exhausted she had but small reserves to draw upon; while the Allies could, with comparatively little difficulty, put five hundred thousand men into the field, and replenish them as there was occasion.\" According to Wikipedia: \"George Alfred Henty (8 December 1832 - 16 November 1902), referred to as G.

It was impossible, in the limits of one book, to give even an outline of the story of the Peninsular War, without devoting the whole space to the military operations. It would, in fact, have been a history rather than a tale; and it accordingly closed with the passage of the Douro, and the expulsion of the French from Portugal.The hero, Terence O'Connor, was the son of the senior captain of the Mayo Fusiliers and, when the regiment was ordered to join Sir Arthur Wellesley's expedition to Portugal, the colonel of the regiment obtained for him a commission; although so notorious was the boy, for his mischievous pranks, that the colonel hesitated whether he would not get into some serious scrapes; especially as Dick Ryan, one of the ensigns, was always his companion in mischief, and both were aided and abetted by Captain O'Grady.However, on the way out, the slow old transport, in which a wing of the regiment was carried, was attacked by two French privateers, who would have either taken or sunk her, had it not been for a happy suggestion of the quick-witted lad. For this he gained great credit, and was selected by General Fane as one of his aides-de-camp. In this capacity he went through the arduous campaign, under General Moore, that ended at Corunna.His father had been so seriously wounded, at Vimiera, that he was invalided home and placed on half pay; and in the same battle Captain O'Grady lost his left arm but, on its being cured, returned to his place in the regiment.At Corunna Terence, while carrying a despatch, was thrown from his horse and stunned; and on recovering found that the British had already embarked on board the ships of the fleet. He made his way to the frontier of Portugal, and thence to Lisbon. He was then appointed to the staff of Sir John Craddock, who was now in command; and sent in charge of some treasure for the use of the Spanish General Romana, who was collecting a force on the northern border of Portugal. Terence had orders to aid him, in any way in his power, to check the invasion of Portugal from the north.Of this order he took advantage when, on the way, the agents of the junta of Oporto endeavoured to rob him; attacking the house where he and his escort had taken up their quarters with a newly-raised levy of two thousand five hundred unarmed peasants. By a ruse he got their leaders into his hands, and these showed such abject cowardice that the peasants refused further to follow them, and asked Terence to take the command of the force.He assented, formed them into two battalions, appointed two British orderlies as majors, the Portuguese officer of his escort lieutenant-colonel, and his troopers captains of companies; put them in the way of obtaining arms and, by dint of hard drill and kindness, converted them into an efficient body of soldiers. Finding that little was to be expected from Romana's force, he acted as a partisan leader and, in this capacity, performed such valuable service that he was confirmed in the command of his force, which received the name of the Minho regiment; and he and his officers received commissions for the rank they held in the Portuguese army."}, {"id": "1644", "title": "The Adventures of Gerard", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Arthur Conan Doyle", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HbFDqUS-tcUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1644/1644-h/1644-h.htm", "desc": "Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventures of Gerard (1903) is an anthology of short stories about the heroics of a Hussar of the French army who lived from the 1780s to 1860s.

It is a towering dome of green among a hundred pinnacles of grey and rust-red crags. At dawn the summit of the mountain has an eagle eye for the far Venetian boundary and the barrier of the Apennines; but with sunrise come the mists. The vast brown level is seen narrowing in; the Ticino and the Sesia waters, nearest, quiver on the air like sleepy lakes; the plain is engulphed up to the high ridges of the distant Southern mountain range, which lie stretched to a faint cloud-like line, in shape like a solitary monster of old seas crossing the Deluge. Long arms of vapour stretch across the urn-like valleys, and gradually thickening and swelling upward, enwrap the scored bodies of the ashen-faced peaks and the pastures of the green mountain, till the heights become islands over a forgotten earth. Bells of herds down the hidden run of the sweet grasses, and a continuous leaping of its rivulets, give the Motterone a voice of youth and homeliness amid that stern company of Titan-heads, for whom the hawk and the vulture cry. The storm has beaten at them until they have got the aspect of the storm. They take colour from sunlight, and are joyless in colour as in shade. When the lower world is under pushing steam, they wear the look of the revolted sons of Time, fast chained before scornful heaven in an iron peace. Day at last brings vigorous fire; arrows of light pierce the mist-wreaths, the dancing draperies, the floors of vapour; and the mountain of piled pasturages is seen with its foot on the shore of Lago Maggiore. Down an extreme gulf the full sunlight, as if darting on a jewel in the deeps, seizes the blue-green lake with its isles. The villages along the darkly-wooded borders of the lake show white as clustered swans; here and there a tented boat is visible, shooting from terraces of vines, or hanging on its shadow. Monte Boscero is unveiled; the semicircle of the Piedmontese and the Swiss peaks, covering Lake Orta, behind, on along the Ticinese and the Grisons, leftward toward and beyond the Lugano hills, stand bare in black and grey and rust-red and purple. You behold a burnished realm of mountain and plain beneath the royal sun of Italy. In the foreground it shines hard as the lines of an irradiated Cellini shield. Farther away, over middle ranges that are soft and clear, it melts, confusing the waters with hot rays, and the forests with darkness, to where, wavering in and out of view like flying wings, and shadowed like wings of archangels with rose and with orange and with violet, silverwhite Alps are seen. You might take them for mystical streaming torches on the border-ground between vision and fancy. They lean as in a great flight forward upon Lombardy."}, {"id": "7748", "title": "The Parisians \u2014 Volume 12", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Royal Historical Society", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ed_6gw5_5TkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7748/7748-h/7748-h.htm", "desc": "Publishes general papers and a section on English politeness: conduct, social rank and moral virtue."}, {"id": "7749", "title": "The Parisians \u2014 Complete", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "\u042d\u0434\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u0411\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0432\u0435\u0440\u041b\u0438\u0442\u0442\u043e\u043d", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m59oDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7749/7749-h/7749-h.htm", "desc": "\"The Parisians \u2014 Complete\" by Baron Edward Bulwer Lytton Lytton.

On the same day another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him. All England wanted him too. England had so longed for him, and hoped for him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the people went nearly mad for joy. Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they kept this up for days and nights together. By day, London was a sight to see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and splendid pageants marching along. By night, it was again a sight to see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry around them. There was no talk in all England but of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him-and not caring, either. But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence.

On the same day another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him. All England wanted him too. England had so longed for him, and hoped for him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the people went nearly mad for joy. Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they kept this up for days and nights together. By day, London was a sight to see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and splendid pageants marching along. By night, it was again a sight to see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry around them. There was no talk in all England but of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him-and not caring, either. But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence.

He turned himself this way and that before the great mirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating the prince's high-bred carriage, and still observing results in the glass. Next he drew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing the blade, and laying it across his breast, as he had seen a noble knight do, by way of salute to the lieutenant of the Tower, five or six weeks before, when delivering the great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity. Tom played with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined the costly and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the sumptuous chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court herd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur. He wondered if they would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home, or if they would shake their heads, and say his overtaxed imagination had at last upset his reason.

In addition, a new retranslation back into English of Mallarm\u00e9's text, which was both praised and criticized for its literalism, reveals the particular tenor and subtleties of his reading of Poe's verse and his feel, as a fellow poet, for the emotive and evocative power of language. The result is a circular exploration of the poem and its translation. The volume also reflects Mallarm\u00e9's specifications for layout, typeface and paper. This is the second in a series exploring Mallarm\u00e9 in translation. The first, A Blow of Dice Never Will Abolish Chance, appeared in 2018; forthcoming is a translation of the second published collaboration between Mallarm\u00e9 and Manet, Afternoon of a Faun (L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune)."}, {"id": "14833", "title": "Varney the Vampire Or the Feast of Blood", "genre": "Horror", "language": "en", "author": "Thomas Preskett Prest", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FN2nDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14833/14833-h/14833-h.htm", "desc": "First published in the year 1847, famous Victorian writer Thomas Preskett Prest's longish gothic story 'Varney the Vampire; Or, the Feast of Blood' was serialized as weekly cheap pamphlets of the kind then known as \"penny dreadfuls\"."}, {"id": "43", "title": "The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde", "genre": "Horror", "language": "en", "author": "Robert Louis Stevenson", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=39wNAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43/43-h/43-h.htm", "desc": "In original paper wrappers."}, {"id": "19797", "title": "Dracula", "genre": "Horror", "language": "en", "author": "Stephanie Spinner", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8bJQPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19797/19797-h/19797-h.htm", "desc": "Having discovered the double identity of the wealthy Transylvanian nobleman, Count Dracula, a small group of people vow to rid the world of the evil vampire."}, {"id": "3781", "title": "The Jewel of Seven Stars", "genre": "Horror", "language": "en", "author": "Bram Stoker", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zh4WAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3781/3781-h/3781-h.htm", "desc": "Purchase one of 1st World Library's Classic Books and help support our free internet library of downloadable eBooks. 1st World Library-Literary Society is a non-profit educational organization.

He is best known for his novels Journey to the Center of the Earth (written in 1864), From the Earth to the Moon (1865), Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1869\u20131870), and Around the World in Eighty Days (1873). Verne wrote about space, air, and underwater travel before navigable aircraft and practical submarines were invented, and before any means of space travel had been devised. Consequently he is often referred to as the \"Father of science fiction\", along with H. G. Wells.

The wind had shifted since noon, while she had been inside, and the dust storm that was sweeping the high deserts to the east was now blowing out over Syrtis. The sun, magnified by the haze, was a gorgeous magenta ball, as large as the sun of Terra, at which she could look directly. Tonight, some of that dust would come sifting down from the upper atmosphere to add another film to what had been burying the city for the last fifty thousand years. The red loess lay over everything, covering the streets and the open spaces of park and plaza, hiding the small houses that had been crushed and pressed flat under it and the rubble that had come down from the tall buildings when roofs had caved in and walls had toppled outward. Here, where she stood, the ancient streets were a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet below the surface; the breach they had made in the wall of the building behind her had opened into the sixth story. She could look down on the cluster of prefabricated huts and sheds, on the brush-grown flat that had been the waterfront when this place had been a seaport on the ocean that was now Syrtis Depression; already, the bright metal was thinly coated with red dust. She thought, again, of what clearing this city would mean, in terms of time and labor, of people and supplies and equipment brought across fifty million miles of space. They'd have to use machinery; there was no other way it could be done. Bulldozers and power shovels and draglines; they were fast, but they were rough and indiscriminate. She remembered the digs around Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, in the Indus Valley, and the careful, patient native laborers\u2014the painstaking foremen, the pickmen and spademen, the long files of basketmen carrying away the earth. Slow and primitive as the civilization whose ruins they were uncovering, yes, but she could count on the fingers of one hand the times one of her pickmen had damaged a valuable object in the ground. If it hadn't been for the underpaid and uncomplaining native laborer, archaeology would still be back where Wincklemann had found it. But on Mars there was no native labor; the last Martian had died five hundred centuries ago."}, {"id": "29882", "title": "Astounding Stories of SuperScience October 1930", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Harry Bates", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ge3cuQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29882/29882-h/29882-h.htm", "desc": "Astounding Stories of Super-Science, October, 1930 by Harry Bates hope, Carnes,\" said Dr. Bird, \"that we get good fishing.\" \"Good fishing?

Still, we perservere, because no matter what else happens this week, you can be sure that someone, somewhere, will win the big one. Lotteries are an unparalleled popular phenomenon. But what happens after the winners are revealed, and the checks have been issued? How does winning a lottery change one's life? Luck of the Draw profiles past winners of big lotteries, and how their windfall impacted their lives, mostly for the better, but interestingly sometimes for the worse, such was the case of a Florida widow who won $5 million in 1984; three years later, she lost her mansion and fancy cars, and owed the IRS $500,000 for back taxes. Eventually she was arrested for trying to hire a contract killer to take out her daughter-in-law, whom she blamed for her lottery misfortune. The book also depicts the past, present and future of lotteries in North America and the world over, and includes a special chapter on the revived phenomenon of big-time TV game show winners. Who wants to be a millionaire? Seemingly, everyone. In a country where eighty percent of adults have played a lottery, creating a multi-billion dollar industry, Luck of the Draw is an insightful inside look at lotteries, its winners, and its losers."}, {"id": "32360", "title": "The Holes Around Mars", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Jerome Bixby", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GgRslQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32360/32360-h/32360-h.htm", "desc": "Spaceship crews should be selected on the basis of their non-irritating qualities as individuals.

Those crises posed fundamental questions for the European Union and its member states, to which Europe has so far proven unable to develop satisfactory answers. This book contends that public debates over wars and humanitarian military interventions after the Cold War represent an evolving process of comprehension and collective interpretation of new realities. Employing innovative computer-linguistic methods, it examines the dynamics of this debate across Europe and compares it to that of the United States. In doing so, it argues that transnational political communication has shaped European identity-formation in significant ways and that, in trying to come to terms with important crises and institutional events, shared understandings of Europe have emerged. Looking at evidence from a wide range of countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and spanning a continuous period of 16 years, this book empirically analyses these shared understandings of the EU as a problem-solving and ethical community. This book will be of interest to students and scholars of international relations, EU politics, security studies, comparative politics, political communication and European integration."}, {"id": "28453", "title": "Flight Through Tomorrow", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Mojie Crigler", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ea0oDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28453/28453-h/28453-h.htm", "desc": "On August 4, 2004, Jason Crigler was onstage in a New York City nightclub when a blood vessel burst in his brain.

This strategy holds the attention of readers who would otherwise reject the subject matter. Fulmer traces the line of descent from Mary Lavin to \u00c9il\u00eds N\u00ed Dhuibhne and from Zora Neale Hurston to Toni Morrison, showing how obstacles to free expression, though varying from those Lavin and Hurston faced, are still encountered by Morrison and N\u00ed Dhuibhne. The basis for comparing these authors lies in the strategies of indirection they use, as influenced by folklore. The folkloric characters these authors depict-wild denizens of the Otherworld and wise women of various traditions-help their creators insert controversy into fiction in ways that charm rather than alienate readers. Forms of rhetorical indirection that appear in the context of folklore, such as signifying practices, masking, sly civility, and the grotesque or bizarre, come out of the mouths and actions of these writers' magical and magisterial characters. Old traditions can offer new ways of discussing issues such as sexual expression, religious beliefs, or issues of reproduction. As differences between times and cultures affect what \"can\" and \"cannot\" be said, folkloric indirection may open up a vista to discourses of which we as readers may not even be aware. Finally, the folk women of Morrison, N\u00ed Dhuibhne, Hurston, and Lavin open up new points of entry to the discussion of fiction, rhetoric, censorship, and folklore"}, {"id": "51533", "title": "The Celestial Hammerlock", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Fritz Leiber", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4gt5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51533/51533-h/51533-h.htm", "desc": "The Science Fiction Archive #2, an amazing collection of the greatest science fiction writing EVER!

They endured heat and cold, rain and drought, despair and loneliness to fulfill their calling They traveled from town to farm to stage-stop to anywhere people had settled, preaching the Gospel. These saddlebag-preachers spoke to anyone who would listen. They were rugged individuals who allowed neither rough terrain nor menacing weather to sway them from their appointed areas of service. These unsung heroes of the West helped bring true civilization to the American frontier. There would be little or no reward beyond the spiritual. This book is a fictionalized story of three such country preachers on the frontier of Texas and the problems they faced bringing the message of Christ to wilderness areas. Bill Wood was born and raised in a small town in Texas. Since 1975, he has pastored ten country churches in either Texas, Louisiana, or California or taught in a small Christian school... or both at the same time. When not preaching or studying or writing, Bro. Bill enjoys visiting antique stores, festivals, and historical places.

Gone with the Wind is often placed in the literary subgenre of the historical romance novel. The epic romance tale set in and around Atlanta, Georgia during the American Civil War has remained a bestseller, even before the equally popular film starring Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh was made in 1939. The novel has also been described as an early classic of the erotic historical genre, because it is thought to contain some degree of pornography. The novel tells of archetypal Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara as she grows from a young woman into maturity against the backdrop of the American Civil War. Like many of the early 20th century Southern writers, Mitchell portrays an idyllic image of the antebellum South. While it can be legitimately criticized for its insensitivity to the treatment of African Americans who were enslaved, Mitchell's novel demonstrates how the South was decimated by the Civil War and continued to suffer under the Northern-sanctioned Restoration."}, {"id": "51854", "title": "The Rat Race", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "John Franklin Carter", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AjgIAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51854/51854-h/51854-h.htm", "desc": "A common man\u2019s journey...

What did so many creative minds find in scripture? Is the Bible still a vital source of poetic inspirations? Chapters Into Verse is the first comprehensive collection ever made of poems written in English inspired by the Bible. A groundbreaking anthology, it introduces readers to a distinct heritage of English poetry: the scriptural tradition. Though frequently ignored and sometimes suppressed, this tradition rivals the classical and is every bit as venerable. Drawing a unique map of the history of English poetry, the two volumes of Chapters Into Verse survey and define the literary legacy of the Scriptures from the fourteenth century to the present. Each volume is arranged in scriptural order, and each poem is preceded by the biblical passage that inspired it. Thus readers can conveniently witness the various ways sacred text has sparked the imagination of poets throughout the ages. In Volume I, which covers Genesis to Malachi, almost every book of the Old Testament is represented. The collection features verses both famous and unfamiliar, from Milton's Paradise Lost and Lord Byron's Hebrew Melodies to Christopher Smart's hymns and Mary Herbert's psalms. The editors have included poems by virtually all the prominent religious poets--among them, John Donne, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Edward Taylor, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Included, too, are devotional and visionary works from a wide range of vintage poets--Robert Burns, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Christina Rossetti, Alfred Tennyson, and Robert Browning. Proving that the Bible is just as powerful a source of inspiration today as it was in the past, the collection assembles a mixed congregation of modern and contemporary poets, such as Marianne Moore, Delmore Schwartz, Dylan Thomas, Robert Frost, William Carlos Williams, Countee Cullen, e.e. cummings, William Butler Yeats, Robert Lowell, Hugh McDiarmid, Laura (Riding) Jackson, Charles Reznikoff, A.D. Hope, Geoffrey Hill, Denise Levertov, Philip Levine, John Ashbery, and Derek Walcott. Of enduring interest to readers of both scripture and literature, this anthology illuminates key passages of the Old Testament. The measured speech and inspired leaps of poetry offer a spirited alternative to the textual exegesis usually supplied by prose commentary. As such, Chapters Into Verse is truly a poets' Bible. In selection after selection, readers will encounter an astonishing variety of religious experiences, as a host of poets from many eras and many backgrounds respond to Holy Scripture spiritually, profoundly, and imaginatively."}, {"id": "24005", "title": "But I Dont Think", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Randall Garrett", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IydsCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24005/24005-h/24005-h.htm", "desc": "I The great merchantship Naipor settled her tens of thousands of tons of mass into her landing cradle on Viornis as gently as an egg being settled into an egg crate, and almost as silently.

These are the times and trials of Dennis Dover, former rock guitarist, photojournalist, and paparazzo. Denny inhabits a world of vibrant color, smell, and sound, where novel experience and unpredictability are anchored by steadfast tradition and history. Mother London's many vagaries give Denny Dover joy and succor, always seducing him home from the Earth's terrible places, where the face of death is as common as the blood that stains the local dirt. And London is where Rosie Beck is, when she isn't off elsewhere combating the planet's great ills. Denny's brilliant, beautiful, socially conscious cousin has always been an indispensable part of his being -- his soul mate and his soul. Since childhood they have been inseparable, delighting in the daily discoveries of a life with no limits. But now the metropolis that nurtured them is threatened by a powerful, unstoppable force that consumes the past indiscriminately and leaves nothing of substance in its wake. The terminator is named John Barbican Begg. A hanger-on from Denny and Rosie's youth, he has become the morally corrupt center of their London and the richest, most rapacious creature in the Western Hemisphere. Now, as their cherished landmarks tumble, conspiracy, secrets, lies, and betrayal become the centerpieces of Rosie and Dennis's days. For Barbican has but one goal: to devour the entire world. And the only choice left is to join in, drop out ... or plot to destroy. A sprawling work of incomparable invention, King of the City is eccentric and remarkable, a unique urban love story with a pit-bull bite that confirms the unparalleled literary genius of the amazing Michael Moorcock."}, {"id": "51712", "title": "A Trace of Memory", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Keith Laumer", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CIigDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51712/51712-h/51712-h.htm", "desc": "He awoke and lay for a moment looking up at a low ceiling, dimly visible in a faint red glow, feeling the hard mat under his back.

In brief chapters that analyze Shavit\u2019s defense of Zionism and Israel\u2019s Jewish identity, its nuclear arsenal and its refusal to negotiate peace, Finkelstein shows how highly selective criticism and sanctimonious handwringing are deployed to create a paean to modern Israel more sophisticated than the traditional our-country-right-or-wrong. In this way, Shavit hopes to win back an American Jewish community increasingly alienated from a place it once regarded as home. However, because the myths he recycles have been so comprehensively shattered, this project is unlikely to succeed. Like his landmark debunking of Joan Peters\u2019s From Time Immemorial, Finkelstein\u2019s clinical dissection of My Promised Land will be welcomed by those who prefer truth to propaganda, and who yearn for a resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict based on justice, rather than arguments framed by anguish and schmaltz."}, {"id": "29194", "title": "Grrr", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Roger Arcot", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nAsuDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29194/29194-h/29194-h.htm", "desc": "Roger Arcot explores the fringes of a really never forgotten world, the introduction to which is an aged manuscript De Necromantiae, and the wish, not too repressed, to pledge your soul to the Devil!

In this vibrant account, Edelstein and Makofske unveil the complex mix of social and scientific factors that have led to public and official misunderstanding of the geologic radon issue. The lessons of radon have great relevance in a contaminated world where people are increasingly surrounded by invisible environmental hazards, where uncertainty and controversy shroud a clear understanding of the threat, and where one can choose apathetic acceptance or attempt to discern how to actively protect oneself and one's family."}, {"id": "32353", "title": "The Mind Digger", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Winston Marks", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xhkuDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32353/32353-h/32353-h.htm", "desc": "There was a reason why his scripts were smash hits\u2014they had realism.

But how much is our country's economic landscape shaped by the huge forces of international capital - and the hope that 'something will turn up' - and how much by the individual men and women at the heart of our economic policy? David Smith forged his career as Britain's leading economic journalist during the country's traumatic transition from the 'workshop of the world' in the Midlands where he grew up, to an economy built on the sometimes shaky foundations of services and the City. Something Will Turn Up is his account of the chancellors, prime ministers, Bank of England governors and senior officials he has encountered and interviewed over the last five decades, and their impact on the realities of modern British life since the war. Smith leads us through the mire of government policy and long-term trends with wit and clarity to paint a vivid, personal picture of how we got to now - and where we might go from here."}, {"id": "28048", "title": "Shepherd of the Planets", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Alan Mattox", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O-gyoU18VUsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28048/28048-h/28048-h.htm", "desc": "Renner had a purpose in life.

The idea of a continuous shared Japanese culture, often described as \"Japanese-ness,\" is epitomized by material items ranging from Zen Buddhist stone gardens and tea ceremony equipment to such archaeological artifacts as the prehistoric Jomon clay figurines. An Archaeological History of Japan challenges this notion by critically examining archaeological evidence as well as the way it has been interpreted. By combining techniques of traditional archaeological investigation with the tools of contemporary critical sociological and anthropological theory, An Archaeological History of Japan reveals the contingent, reflexive nature of how the prehistoric inhabitants of the Japanese islands identified themselves as they mapped their social and cultural environment. Koji Mizoguchi demonstrates that this process of self-identification underwent transformations as societies and technology changed, indicating that there is no intrinsic connection binding present-day Japanese with people of the past."}, {"id": "29326", "title": "The Great Drought", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Capt Sp Meek", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RfVj3xdLQIoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29326/29326-h/29326-h.htm", "desc": "Another episode in Dr. Bird's extraordinary duel with the scientific wizard Saranoff."}, {"id": "29897", "title": "Runaway", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Wendelin Van Draanen", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T6M5QKeXHSMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29897/29897-h/29897-h.htm", "desc": "After running away from her fifth foster home, Holly, a twelve-year-old orphan, travels across the country, keeping a journal of her experiences and struggle to survive."}, {"id": "26882", "title": "Omega the Man", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Lowell Howard Morrow", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lP-aDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26882/26882-h/26882-h.htm", "desc": "Lowell Howard Morrow, probably best known for his science fiction story \"Omega, the Man\", was a noted American author."}, {"id": "33642", "title": "Earth Alert", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Anthony Sailer", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=olXeAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33642/33642-h/33642-h.htm", "desc": "All is quiet on Earth as everything appears normal.

Now here it is, collected in one volume, with a new cover, and a new title, Revenge! Over the years, Jonah McKee acquired vast wealth, power, and an unsavory reputation. Though his fatal car crash is ruled accidental, his widow is convinced otherwise and begs her children to find the truth. Eldest son Max knew his late father could be manipulative, but a letter found among Jonah's possessions shows just how many lives were subject to his meddling. That list includes Max's brother, Jenner--rodeo rider and rebel--who is confronted by a confession that changes his life. But even while the siblings reel from new revelations, stubborn, beautiful Casey McKee is kidnapped by an enemy who hates the family enough to destroy them, one by one...

The United States was, of course, involved, but only through McFate's employer, the military contractor DynCorp International. Throughout the world, similar scenarios are playing out daily. The United States can no longer go to war without contractors. Yet we don't know much about the industry's structure, its operations, or where it's heading. Typically led by ex-military men, contractor firms are by their very nature secretive. Even the U.S. government-the entity that actually pays them-knows relatively little. In The Modern Mercenary, Sean McFate lays bare this opaque world, explaining the economic structure of the industry and showing in detail how firms operate on the ground. A former U.S. Army paratrooper and private military contractor, McFate provides an unparalleled perspective into the nuts and bolts of the industry, as well as a sobering prognosis for the future of war. While at present, the U.S. government and U.S. firms dominate the market, private military companies are emerging from other countries, and warlords and militias have restyled themselves as private security companies in places like Afghanistan and Somalia. To understand how the proliferation of private forces may influence international relations, McFate looks back to the European Middle Ages, when mercenaries were common and contract warfare the norm. He concludes that international relations in the twenty-first century may have more in common with the twelfth century than the twentieth. This \"back to the future\" situation, which he calls \"neomedievalism,\" is not necessarily a negative condition, but it will produce a global system that contains rather than solves problems. The Modern Mercenary is the first work that combines a broad-ranging theory of the phenomenon with an insider's understanding of what the world of the private military industry is actually like."}, {"id": "40954", "title": "Potential Enemy", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Wesley K Wark", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=57lcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40954/40954-h/40954-h.htm", "desc": "How realistically did the British government assess the threat from Nazi Germany during the 1930s? How accurate was British intelligence's understanding of Hitler's aims and Germany's military and industrial capabilities? In The Ultimate Enemy, Wesley K. Wark catalogues the many misperceptions about Nazi Germany that were often fostered by British intelligence. This book, the product of exhaustive archival research, first looks at the goals of British intelligence in the 1930s. He explains the various views of German power held by the principal Whitehall authorities\u2014including the various military intelligence directorates and the semi-clandestine Industrial Intelligence Centre\u2014and he describes the efforts of senior officials to fit their perceptions of German power into the framework of British military and diplomatic policy. Identifying the four phases through which the British intelligence effort evolved, he assesses its shortcomings and successes, and he calls into question the underlying premises of British intelligence doctrine. Wark shows that faulty intelligence assessments were crucial in shaping the British policy of appeasement up to the outbreak of World War II. His book offers a new perspective on British policy in the interwar period and also contributes a fascinating case study in the workings of intelligence services during a period of worldwide crisis."}, {"id": "30339", "title": "Status Quo", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Graeme Stroud", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LVZDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30339/30339-h/30339-h.htm", "desc": "Every song on every album by the classic line-up dissected and discussedThe stories behind the songs, their context within the parent albums and the times they were written and recordedThe release date of every single and B-side trackWhat the band and critics had/have to say about their musical development After their initial inception as a schoolboy band in 1962, and following a number of band name and personnel changes, Status Quo eventually hit the charts in 1968 with the massive hit single \u2018Pictures of Matchstick Men\u2019.

In early May 2006, a young British climber named David Sharp lay dying near the top of Mount Everest while forty other climbers walked past him on their way to the summit. A week later, Lincoln Hall, a seasoned Australian climber, was left for dead near the same spot. Hall\u2019s death was reported around the world, but the next day he was found alive after spending the night on the upper mountain with no food and no shelter. If David Sharp\u2019s death was shocking, it was not singular: despite unusually good weather, ten others died attempting to reach the summit that year. In this meticulous inquiry into what went wrong, Nick Heil tells the full story of the deadliest year on Everest since the infamous season of 1996. He introduces Russell Brice, the outfitter who has done more than anyone to provide access to the summit via the mountain\u2019s north side\u2013and who some believe was partially responsible for Sharp\u2019s death. As more climbers attempt the summit each year, Heil shows how increasingly risky expeditions and unscrupulous outfitters threaten to turn Everest into a deadly circus. Written by an experienced climber and outdoor writer, Dark Summit is both a riveting account of a notorious climbing season and a troubling investigation into whether the pursuit of the ultimate mountaineering prize has spiralled out of control.

It has also been deemed responsible for earthquakes, causing untold suffering among earth's people. But so far the effect of the moon has been rather an inhuman affair. No man has gone to the moon to see just what conditions are there, and to observe accurately the influence that the moon and earth exercise over each other.

Its vast reach and lingering effects have made it difficult to pinpoint its exact cause, and while some economists point to the risks inherent in the modern financial system, others blame long-term imbalances in the world economy. Into this debate steps Paul Mattick, who, in Business as Usual, explains the global economic downturn in relation to the development of the world economy since World War II, but also as a fundamental example of the cycle of crisis and recovery that has characterized capitalism since the early nineteenth century. Mattick explains that today\u2019s recession is not the result of a singular financial event but instead is a manifestation of long-term processes within the world economy. Mattick argues that the economic downturn can best be understood within the context of business cycles, which are unavoidable in a free-market economy. He uses this explanation as a springboard for exploring the nature of our capitalist society and its prospects for the future. Although Business as Usual engages with many economic theories, both mainstream and left-wing, Mattick\u2019s accessible writing opens the subject up in order for non-specialists to understand the current economic climate not as the effect of a financial crisis, but as a manifestation of a truth about the social and economic system in which we live. As a result the book is ideal for anyone who wants to gain a succinct and jargon-free understanding of recent economic events, and, just as important, the overall dynamics of the capitalist system itself."}, {"id": "51615", "title": "A Matter of Protocol", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Jack Sharkey", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8VsPDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51615/51615-h/51615-h.htm", "desc": "First Contact was always dangerous\u2014but usually only to the man involved!"}, {"id": "23159", "title": "Stairway to the Stars", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Max Gorman", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jZJUzAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23159/23159-h/23159-h.htm", "desc": "The book provides an introduction to mystical philosophy and the concept of inner development by looking at a number of its great schools.

A furious Pope Innocent III accused heretics of the crime and called upon all Christians to exterminate heresy between the Garonne and Rhone rivers--a vast region now known as Languedoc--in a great crusade. This most holy war, the first in which Christians were promised salvation for killing other Christians, lasted twenty bloody years--it was a long savage battle for the soul of Christendom. In A Most Holy War, historian Mark Pegg has produced a swift-moving, gripping narrative of this horrific crusade, drawing in part on thousands of testimonies collected by inquisitors in the years 1235 to 1245. These accounts of ordinary men and women, remembering what it was like to live through such brutal times, bring the story vividly to life. Pegg argues that generations of historians (and novelists) have misunderstood the crusade; they assumed it was a war against the Cathars, the most famous heretics of the Middle Ages. The Cathars, Pegg reveals, never existed. He further shows how a millennial fervor about \"cleansing\" the world of heresy, coupled with a fear that Christendom was being eaten away from within by heretics who looked no different than other Christians, made the battles, sieges, and massacres of the crusade almost apocalyptic in their cruel intensity. In responding to this fear with a holy genocidal war, Innocent III fundamentally changed how Western civilization dealt with individuals accused of corrupting society. This fundamental change, Pegg argues, led directly to the creation of the inquisition, the rise of an anti-Semitism dedicated to the violent elimination of Jews, and even the holy violence of the Reconquista in Spain and in the New World in the fifteenth century. All derive their divinely sanctioned slaughter from the Albigensian Crusade. Haunting and immersive, A Most Holy War opens an important new perspective on a truly pivotal moment in world history, a first and distant foreshadowing of the genocide and holy violence in the modern world."}, {"id": "33854", "title": "Ask a Foolish Question", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Robert Sheckley", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VmUPDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33854/33854-h/33854-h.htm", "desc": "It's well established now that the way you put a question often determines not only the answer you'll get, but the type of answer possible.

His resignation speech against that war prompted the first standing ovation in the history of the House and marked the end of the ministerial career of one of Labour's most brilliant politicians. His arguments against that war are of profound interest and importance to American readers. For the two years prior to his resignation, Robin Cook kept a diary, a personal record of Labour's second term, that forms the core of this narrative. The Point of Departure is Robin Cook's unvarnished account of this dramatic period in British political history. Though surprised by his abrupt dismissal in 2001 as Foreign Secretary, he became determined to effect the changes in Parliamentary democracy that he believed were essential if Parliament was to move into the twenty-first century. As Tony Blair told Cook on offering him leadership of the House of Commons, \"This is the job for you.\" Drawing on firsthand experiences in the Commons and the Cabinet, of encounters in conferences and corridors and late-night conversations, Cook details his gathering disillusionment with Tony Blair's change of direction, which he believes to be profoundly mistaken, and, above all, the change in foreign policy that led the United Kingdom away from its destiny in Europe and into participation in President Bush's war in Iraq. This is the inside story of a government in power -- and of the tensions between those who govern. But above all it is the story of a politician who genuinely wanted to bring democracy closer to the people, but who saw a government increasingly detached from the values of himself and his party, and who developed a growing conviction that the government position on Iraq was morally, diplomatically, and politically wrong."}, {"id": "25035", "title": "The Happy Unfortunate", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Robert Silverberg", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EGAStvLZp5kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25035/25035-h/25035-h.htm", "desc": "Dekker, back from space, found great physical changes in the people of Earth; changes that would have horrified him five years before.

The machine had not originally given him a job commensurate with his talents; why should it suddenly recognize them? He'd known of people who had been reclassified-always downward.

All he had was the right to refuse any job he could claim was not in his line; the government would then be obligated to continue his existence.

And most of them think it could never happen to them. Because they don't recognize the subtle danger signs, they can suddenly find themselves in a dangerous relationship -- with devastating consequences. It can start off innocently enough. Someone cares enough to pay attention. To look into your eyes. To touch with understanding. Even with the best of motives, it's easy to slip gradually, almost imperceptibly, into the snare of an emotional or sexual entanglement. In The Snare -- a frank, sometimes startling book -- Lois Mowday Rabey gives us a clear look at the paths to sexual immorality using real-life accounts of Christians who have struggled and failed. She returns repeatedly to the single focus that conquers temptation: a strong personal relationship with Christ. And she outlines the clear guidelines in Scripture for establishing healthy relationships in today's value neutral\u00d3 world. Rabey offers specific advice for conduct in the workplace (where many affairs begin), for gracefully getting out of compromising situations, and for single adults (whether never married, widowed, or divorced). We shouldn't push the issue of immorality aside because we seem to be okay, because we feel secure in the center of an evangelical church, have daily devotions, and memorize Scripture,\u00d3 writes Rabey. We can have all these right practices and more, yet still fall.\u00d3 Emotional and sexual entanglements are a snare. They are so enticing, so promising, and they offer something that seems so good. Lois Mowday Rabey helps us see them for the dangerous trap they really are. And she offers help to those wanting to avoid the snare or escape its grasp. Whether you work with people who struggle with this issue or you just want to protect yourself against the subtle snare of immorality, 'The Snare' is an invaluable resource."}, {"id": "29437", "title": "The Martian Cabal", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Roman Frederick Starzl", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j-UKkAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29437/29437-h/29437-h.htm", "desc": "Roman Frederick Starzl was an American author.

The terms usually proposed to describe aspects of mediation, especially perspective, point of view, and focalization, have yet to bring clarity to this field, which is of central importance, not only for narratology but also for literary and media studies. One crucial problem about mediation concerns the dimensions of its modeling effect, particularly the precise status and constellation of the mediating agents, i.e. author, narrator or presenter and characters. The question is how are the structure and the meaning of the story conditioned by these different positions in relation to the mediated happenings perceived from outside and/or inside the storyworld? In this volume, fourteen articles by international scholars from seven different countries address these problems anew from various angles, reviewing the sub-categorization of mediation and re-specifying its dimensions both in literary texts and other media such as drama and theater, film, and computer games"}, {"id": "22301", "title": "Valley of Dreams", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Lauraine Snelling", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7ODd_YZRCYYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22301/22301-h/22301-h.htm", "desc": "When Cassie Lockwood's father dies and the manager of his Wild West show drives it into debt before taking off with the remaining money, she decides to look for the hidden valley where her father dreamed of settling."}, {"id": "22890", "title": "The Worlds of If", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Stanely G Weinbaum", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YEoVBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22890/22890-h/22890-h.htm", "desc": "Join Haskel van Manderpootz and Dixon Wells in another adventure!

Herbert George Wells (1866 - 1946) was a prolific English writer who wrote in a variety of genres, including the novel, politics, history, and social commentary.

The State of Kerala has been hailed as a success story in accommodating gender concerns in local-level planning and political decentralisation; this conclusion has been based on relatively simple evaluative exercises that ask whether women of diverse backgrounds have gained entry into formal institutions of governance or not. This book seeks to place political decentralisation and its possibilities for women within the historical and contemporary contexts. Against the popular assumption that the liberal feminist promise made by the state will be delivered, say, once the noxious influence of male relatives is removed, the book points to the multiple social forces that shape possibilities and hindrances for women, and reshape gender divisions in the political field. The book thus pays attention to women in both local governance and politics. Secondly, it examines how women have utilised, extended, survived within or subverted these spaces. In the present context in which fifty per cent of the seats in the institutions of local self-government are being reserved for women, and there exists considerable skepticism about reservations for women in the Parliament, this book offers reflections on both local governance and \u2018high\u2019 politics.

Now the acclaimed author turns to World War I, bringing to life the sweeping, emotional story of the war that devastated a generation and established America as a world power. Spring 1916: the horror of a stalemate on Europe\u2019s western front. France and Great Britain are on one side of the barbed wire, a fierce German army is on the other. Shaara opens the window onto the otherworldly tableau of trench warfare as seen through the eyes of a typical British soldier who experiences the bizarre and the horrible\u2013a \u201cTommy\u201d whose innocent youth is cast into the hell of a terrifying war. In the skies, meanwhile, technology has provided a devastating new tool, the aeroplane, and with it a different kind of hero emerges\u2013the flying ace. Soaring high above the chaos on the ground, these solitary knights duel in the splendor and terror of the skies, their courage and steel tested with every flight. As the conflict stretches into its third year, a neutral America is goaded into war, its reluctant president, Woodrow Wilson, finally accepting the repeated challenges to his stance of nonalignment. Yet the Americans are woefully unprepared and ill equipped to enter a war that has become worldwide in scope. The responsibility is placed on the shoulders of General John \u201cBlackjack\u201d Pershing, and by mid-1917 the first wave of the American Expeditionary Force arrives in Europe. Encouraged by the bold spirit and strength of the untested Americans, the world waits to see if the tide of war can finally be turned. From Blackjack Pershing to the Marine in the trenches, from the Red Baron to the American pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille, To the Last Man is written with the moving vividness and accuracy that characterizes all of Shaara\u2019s work. This spellbinding new novel carries readers\u2013the way only Shaara can\u2013to the heart of one of the greatest conflicts in human history, and puts them face-to-face with the characters who made a lasting impact on the world."}, {"id": "19695", "title": "Fortyone Thieves A Tale of California", "genre": "Western", "language": "en", "author": "Angelo Hall", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sJ_DDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19695/19695-h/19695-h.htm", "desc": "\"Forty-one Thieves: A Tale of California\" by Angelo Hall.

The Corvey Collection comprises one of the most important collections of Romantic era writing in existence anywhere -- including fiction, short prose, dramatic works, poetry, and more -- with a focus on especially difficult-to-find works by lesser-known, historically neglected writers. The Corvey library was built during the last half of the 19th century by Victor and his wife Elise, both bibliophiles with varied interests. The collection thus contains everything from novels and short stories to belles lettres and more populist works, and includes many exceedingly rare works not available in any other collection from the period. These invaluable, sometimes previously unknown works are of particular interest to scholars and researchers. European Literature, 1790-1840: The Corvey Collection includes: * Novels and Gothic Novels * Short Stories * Belles-Lettres * Short Prose Forms * Dramatic Works * Poetry * Anthologies * And more Selected with the guidance of an international team of expert advisors, these primary sources are invaluable for a wide range of academic disciplines and areas of study, providing never before possible research opportunities for one of the most studied historical periods.

The handbook offers a synthesis of the state of scholarship regarding the international radiation of Futurism and its influence in some fifteen artistic disciplines and thirty-eight countries. While acknowledging the great achievements of the movement in the visual and literary arts of Italy and Russia, it treats Futurism as an international, multidisciplinary phenomenon that left a lasting mark on the manifold artistic manifestations of the early twentieth-century avant-garde. Hundreds of artists, who in some phase in their career absorbed Futurist ideas and stylistic devices, are presented in the context of their national traditions, their international connections and the media in which they were predominantly active.

Kuno, der Sohn des Grafen, liegt krank im Bett und wird von zwei Frauen betreut, von seiner alten Amme und von seiner Stiefmutter, einer g\u00fctigen jungen Frau. Die Amme erz\u00e4hlt ihr, dass es in diesem Schloss nicht nur gute Stiefm\u00fctter hat und sie f\u00e4ngt an zu erz\u00e4hlen: In diesem Schloss lebte einst ein kluger und guter Graf, dessen Frau von allen ,,die gute Gr\u00e4fin\" genannt wurde. Sie war bek\u00fcmmert, weil sie scheinbar keine Kinder bekommen konnte. Als der weise Zauberer Cyprianus verwundet und von Gr\u00e4fin gesund gepflegt wird, entwickelt sich eine Freundschaft zwischen den beiden. Die Gr\u00e4fin erz\u00e4hlt dem Zauberer von ihrem Kummer. Cyprianus schickt ihr nach seiner Abreise einen Spiegel, in den sie immer wieder schauen solle. Sie solle aber wissen, dass sie Gottes Wege nicht umleiten k\u00f6nne und dass der Spiegel niemals eine Bluttat sehen d\u00fcrfe, sonst werde sich das Schicksal gegen die Nachkommen richten. Die Frau sieht von nun an jeden Tag in den Spiegel, und eines Tages sieht sie im Spiegel einen Nebel, aus dem ein Kindergesicht auftaucht. Doch nur ihrem Mann f\u00e4llt auf, dass das Bildnis Kind im Spiegel weint. Bald bringt sie einen Jungen zur Welt, der Kuno genannt wird, so wie der Stiefsohn der sp\u00e4teren Gr\u00e4fin. Bald nach Kunos Geburt stirbt die Mutter an einer Seuche. Die Trauer ist gro\u00df. Einige Jahre sp\u00e4ter beschlie\u00dft der Graf, sich in Wien eine neue Frau zu suchen. Die Frau, die er aus Wien mitbringt, ist wundersch\u00f6n, und jeder, der sie sieht, ist ihrem Zauber verfallen, bis auf Kuno und den klugen Hausmeister. Ein fremder Oberst namens Hager kommt an den Hof, der sich als Vetter des ehemaligen Ehemannes der neuen Gr\u00e4fin ausgibt. Er bleibt am Hof und geht h\u00e4ufig mit dem Grafen auf die Jagd. Doch eines Tages verungl\u00fcckt der Graf bei einer Wildschweinjagd und seine Witwe bleibt die alleinige Herrscherin \u00fcber das Schloss. Inzwischen hat sie einen Sohn geboren, der den Namen Wolf tr\u00e4gt. Die beiden Halbbr\u00fcder lieben einander innig, auch wenn der Oberst immer wieder versucht, einen Keil zwischen beide zu treiben, und die Gr\u00e4fin w\u00fcrde Kuno lieber tot zu sehen. Sie verspricht Hager, Herr \u00fcber das Schloss zu werden, wenn er Kuno umbringt. Aus Zufall t\u00f6tet er Kuno vor dem Spiegel des Cyprianus, und als sein j\u00fcngerer Bruder eines Tages in den Spiegel sieht, entsteht auf seiner Brust der gleiche rote Fleck wie bei seinem Bruder, und er stirbt ebenfalls. Hier endet die Erz\u00e4hlung der alten Amme. Erschrocken stellt die junge Stiefmutter fest, dass die b\u00f6se Gr\u00e4fin aus der Geschichte ihre eigene Vorfahrin ist. Demnach ist auch ihr Stiefsohn Kuno dem Tode geweiht. Doch als der Spiegel als letzte Hoffnung der Amme herangeschafft wird, wird der junge Graf wieder gesund, und er sieht die beiden Knaben Kuno und Wolf l\u00e4chelnd als Engel zum Himmel fliegen. Die junge Gr\u00e4fin aber sieht ein neues Kindergesicht im Nebel auftauchen und beschlie\u00dft, das Kind, falls es ein Junge wird, Wolf zu nennen."}, {"id": "19733", "title": "Das kleine Dummerle und andere Erz\u00e4hlungen", "genre": "German fiction", "language": "de", "author": "Agnes Sapper", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w0uDCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19733/19733-h/19733-h.htm", "desc": "Reproduktion des Originals in Gro\u00dfdruckschrift."}, {"id": "46561", "title": "Keltische KnochenGedel\u00f6cke Erz\u00e4hlungen", "genre": "German fiction", "language": "de", "author": "Bernhard Maier", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7AvdTqwucfwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/46561/46561-h/46561-h.htm", "desc": "The definitive reference work on this topic. `(The author takes) the Celtic world to include both the European continent and the more recent settlements in the British Isles.

Wer sich f\u00fcr dieses Thema interessiert, kann eigentlich so ziemlich bedenkenlos zugreifen - ganz besonders, da dieses Buch ziemlich packend geschrieben ist, voller Doppeldeutigkeiten und Sprachwitz steckt, und nebenbei auch noch das Kunstst\u00fcck fertigbringt, eine bissige Gesellscahftssatire zu sein! Wie alle B\u00fccher Meyrinks von einer eigent\u00fcmlich dichten okkulten Atmosph\u00e4re durchdrungen sind, die genau den Punkt der Verwandlung eines Menschen betrachten, so ist auch das \"Gr\u00fcne Gesicht\" eine Suche nach der letzten Wahrheit.

Er war als Literat nur am Berliner Hof um 1703 namhaft. Dort fiel er der germanistischen Forschung als Gelegenheitsdichter ohne Niveau auf. Alle anderen Werke erschienen unter verschiedenen Pseudonymen, sodass Reuters Autorschaft erst erschlossen werden musste. Ist dieser Reisebericht das erste Satirebuch? Nun, jedenfalls bis heute eines der besten: Die Reisebeschreibung von Christian Reuter aus dem Jahre 1696 ging zu Recht in die deutsche Literaturgeschichte ein, August Gottfried B\u00fcrger nahm sogar die ma\u00dflosen \u00dcbertreibungen als Vorlage f\u00fcr seine M\u00fcnchhausen-Geschichten. Schelmuffsky ist dem \u00e4ltesten Sohn der Wirtin Anna Rosine M\u00fcller aus Leipzig nachgebildet und Ich-Erz\u00e4hler des gleichnamigen Romans in Form einer Reisebeschreibung. Die Germanistik ist sich nicht ganz schl\u00fcssig, ob es sich um einen Schelmenroman, einen Abenteuerroman oder um eine M\u00fcnchhausiade handelt. Der Erz\u00e4hler ist eine Art Kamera, die Eindr\u00fccke ungefiltert wiedergibt. Auf diese Weise charakterisiert er sich selbst, ohne sich dessen bewusst zu sein, indem er im Wesentlichen vom Fressen, Saufen und Sich\u00fcbergeben berichtet. Gleichzeitig gibt er h\u00f6fische Formen und Feste, Galanterie und die damals \u00fcbliche ma\u00dflose \u00dcbertreibung in den vermehrt aufkommenden Reisebeschreibungen der L\u00e4cherlichkeit preis.

Man kann nicht gut sagen, er h\u0160tte herausgeragt aus der Schar der anderen, denn er war klein, pockennarbig, rothaarig, kurzsichtig, hatte eine Glatze und kleine verrunzelte B\u0160ckchen, und aus seiner Gesichtsfarbe konnte man auf H\u0160morrhoiden schlie\u00a7en. Doch dagegen ist nichts zu machen. Schuld tr\u0160gt das Petersburger Klima. Um seinen Rang nicht zu vergessen, da man bei uns vor allem den Rang angeben mu\u00a7 \u00d0 er war das, was man einen ewigen Titularrat nennt, \u0178ber welchen sich bekanntlich hier schon verschiedene Schriftsteller lustig gemacht haben; diese k\u0161nnen nun einmal\u00canicht von der Gewohnheit lassen, gerade auf solche Leute loszugehen, die sich nicht wehren k\u0161nnen. Er hie\u00a7 Baschmatschkin, und sein Vorname lautete Akaki Akakiewitsch. Es ist wohl m\u0161glich, da\u00a7 letzterer dem Leser merkw\u0178rdig und ein wenig gesucht erscheine, doch ich kann ihm versichern, da\u00a7 nach diesem Namen in Wirklichkeit nicht gesucht worden war, da\u00a7 vielmehr Umst\u0160nde eingetreten waren, die jeden anderen ausschlossen, und das hatte sich so zugetragen. Akaki Akakiewitsch wurde, wenn ich mich recht erinnere, in der Nacht des 23. M\u0160rz geboren. Seine selige Mutter, eine Beamtenfrau und ein \u0178beraus braves Weib, machte, wie sich das geh\u0161rt, sofort Anstalten, da\u00a7 das Kind getauft werde. Sie lag noch im Bett, und rechts von ihr stand der Pate Iwan Iwanowitsch Jeroschkin, Abteilungschef im Senat und ein ganz ausgezeichneter Mann, und die Patin Arina Semenowa Bjelobruschowa, die Gattin eines Polizeileutnants und zudem mit seltenen Tugenden begabt. Pate und Patin lie\u00a7en der W\u0161chnerin die Wahl zuerst unter folgenden drei Namen: Mokia, Sossia und Chosdadat, der M\u0160rtyrer, doch sie wollte nicht: \u00c8Nein, das sind alles so Namen.\u00c7 Um sie zufriedenzustellen, wurde der Kalender an einer anderen Stelle aufgeschlagen, und da kamen die Namen: Trefilius, Dula und Barachassius heraus. \u00c8Das ist ja wie eine Strafe Gottes!\u00c7 rief jetzt die Mutter. \u00c8Was f\u0178r schreckliche Namen! Nie noch habe ich diese Namen geh\u0161rt! Wenn wenigstens Barabas oder Baruch dast\u0178nde \u00d0 aber Trefilius undBarachassius! Ach! Ach!\u00c7 Noch einmal drehten der Pate und die Patin die Seite um: da standen aber Pafsikachius und Bachtissius. \u00c8Ich sehe schon,\u00c7 schrie jetzt die Alte, \u00c8das ist sein Los. Und weil es nicht anders sein kann, so soll er wie sein Vater hei\u00a7en. Dieser hie\u00a7 Akaki und darum soll auch sein Sohn so hei\u00a7en!\u00c7 So kam es also zu Akaki Akakiewitsch. Die Taufe wurde nun vollzogen, und dabei weinte das Kn\u0160blein und verzog das Gesicht so, als h\u0160tte es vorausgef\u0178hlt, da\u00a7 es einmal Titularrat sein w\u0178rde. Ich habe das alles ausgef\u0178hrt, damit der Leser selber sehe, da\u00a7 es gar nicht anders sein konnte und ein anderer Name unter diesen Umst\u0160nden rein unm\u0161glich und g\u0160nzlich ausgeschlossen gewesen w\u0160re."}, {"id": "49395", "title": "Oesterreich im Jahre 2020 Socialpolitischer Roman", "genre": "Social life and customs", "language": "de", "author": "Josef von Neupauer", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UMrODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/49395/49395-h/49395-h.htm", "desc": "\"Oesterreich im Jahre 2020\" von Josef von Neupauer.

The story was also included in the collection \"A Hunger Artist\" (\"Ein Hungerk\u00fcnstler\"), the last book Kafka prepared for publication, printed by \"Verlag Die Schmiede\" after Kafka's death. The protagonist, a hunger artist who experiences the decline in appreciation of his craft, is an archetypical creation of Kafka: an individual marginalized and victimized by society at large. The title of the story has been translated also to \"A Fasting Artist\" and \"A Starvation Artist\". \"Ein Hungerk\u00fcnstler\" ist eine Erz\u00e4hlung von Franz Kafka, die erstmals 1922 in der Zeitung \"Die neue Rundschau\" erschien.

Andreas Kramer nimmt in seiner Studie neben den expressionistischen Literarisierungen des Sports auch soziokulturelle Kontexte und Codierungen in den Blick und geht damit \u00fcber die blo\u00dfe Motivgeschichte eines kulturhistorischen Ansatzes hinaus. Expressionistische Sporttexte loten h\u00e4ufig als Bestandteile der korporalen und der symbolischen Kultur der Moderne das Spannungsgeflecht von individueller Befreiung und kollektiver Disziplinierung aus. Der Autor zeigt dies an vier Sportarten, die unterschiedliche Wettkampfformen repr\u00e4sentieren, sich ab Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts herausbildeten und rasch zum popul\u00e4ren Massensport bzw. kommerziell organisierten Zuschauersport wurden: Boxen, Tennis, Radrennfahren und Fu\u00dfball. This is the first monograph to examine the role of modern sports in Expressionist literature. Adopting a cultural-historical approach, the study analyses sport themes in Expressionism alongside socio-cultural contexts and meanings. Expressionist texts on sport thus become integral elements of the corporal and the symbolic cultures of modernity that frequently tease out tensions between individual, vitalising liberation and collective, devitalising disciplining of the sporting body. In using boxing, tennis, cycling and football, the study takes as its main examples four sports that arrived in Germany from the late 19th century to quickly become popular mass sports and commercial spectator sports."}, {"id": "45644", "title": "Guirlanden um Die Urnen der Zukunft\r Eine interessante originelle Familiengeschichte aus dem drei und zwanzigsten Jahrhunderte", "genre": "Literature", "language": "de", "author": "A K Ruh", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4fenBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/45644/45644-h/45644-h.htm", "desc": "Die Welt in 100 Jahren ist Wissenschaftsbuch des Jahres!

The papers review the algebraical and topological foundations of geometry and cover topics ranging from the geometric algebra of the M\u00f6bius plane to the theory of parallels with applications to closed geodesies. Groups of homeomorphisms and topological descriptive planes are also discussed. Comprised of 26 chapters, this book introduces the reader to the theory of parallels with applications to closed geodesies; groups of homeomorphisms; complemented modular lattices; and topological descriptive planes. Subsequent chapters focus on collineation groups; exceptional algebras and exceptional groups; the connection between algebra and constructions with ruler and compasses; and the use of differential geometry and analytic group theory methods in foundations of geometry. Von Staudt projectivities of Moufang planes are also considered, and an axiomatic treatment of polar geometry is presented.

Andrea Delfin kommt nach Venedig. Mit sich f\u00fchrt er drei Dolche, jeder tr\u00e4gt die Inschrift: \u00bbTod allen Inquisitoren\u00ab eingraviert. Die Inquisitoren sind im alten Venedig die Vollzugsbeamten der M\u00e4chtigen, sie sind Ankl\u00e4ger, Richter und Vollstrecker in einem. Ihre Herrschaft ist ber\u00fcchtigt. Andrea Delfin will den Tod der Schwester und des Bruders r\u00e4chen. Der Text ist eine spannende Schilderung der Herrschaftsverh\u00e4ltnisse, unter denen Bespitzelung, Verrat aber auch blankes Denunziantentum und politische R\u00e4nke und Meuchelmorde an der Tagesordnung waren. Eine schreckliche Zeit, in der nur Adlige und der Klerus frei waren, alle anderen Menschen mussten damit rechnen jeden Augenblick unter beh\u00f6rdlicher Willk\u00fcr f\u00fcr ewig weggesperrt oder gelyncht zu werden; ein falscher Verdacht, eine getuschelte Bemerkung \u2013 ob wahr oder nicht \u2013 waren genug. \u00bbDen Schafen aber ist es gleich, Herr Delfin, ob sie geschlachtet oder vom Wolf gefressen werden ...\u00ab Mein Bruder wurde nach Venedig gerufen, sich zu verantworten. Als er kam, wurde er unter die Bleid\u00e4cher gef\u00fchrt, und viele Wochen lang suchte man bald durch Drohungen, bald durch verlockende Anerbietungen ihn zu Gest\u00e4ndnissen zu bewegen. Jenen einen Schritt brauchte er nicht zu besch\u00f6nigen; er war gesetzlich. Anderes hatte er nicht zu gestehen, da wir nichts gegen den Staat unternommen hatten. So musste man ihn endlich entlassen. Aber man dachte nicht daran, ihn zu begnadigen. Ich selbst hatte ihn schriftlich gebeten, nicht sogleich abzureisen, um nicht neuen Verdacht zu erwecken. Wir wollten ihn lieber einige Monate l\u00e4nger entbehren. Als er endlich kam, sollten wir ihn nach wenigen Tagen f\u00fcr immer missen. Er erlag einem langsam wirkenden Gift, das man ihm in einem der gl\u00e4nzenden H\u00e4user, die er besuchte, unter die Speisen gemischt hatte. Noch war der Stein \u00fcber seinem Grabe nicht aufgerichtet, als der Gouverneur der Provinz meiner Schwester seine Hand antrug. Sie wies sie mit Entr\u00fcstung zur\u00fcck; in ihrem Schmerz entfuhren ihr Worte, die ihren Nachhall im Saal des Inquisitionstribunals finden sollten.
