This book now brings together a fully-representative set of texts setting out the many and various sources from which we get our knowledge of the legend. These texts, spanning a time period from the Crusades to the Enlightenment, are presented in their original languages and in English translation (for many it is the first time they have been available in English). The story of the mysterious oriental leader Prester John, ruler of a land teeming with marvels who may come to the aid of Christians in the Levant, held an intense grip on the medieval mind from the first references in twelfth-century Crusader literature and into the early-modern period. But Prester John was a man of shifting identity, being at different times and for different reasons associated with Chingis Khan and the Mongols, with the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia, with China, Tibet, South Africa and West Africa. In order to orient the reader, each of these iterations is explained in the comprehensive introduction, and in the introductions to texts and sections. The introduction also raises a thorny question not often considered: whether or not medieval audiences believed in the reality of Prester John and the Prester John Letter. The book is completed with three valuable appendices: a list of all known references to Prester John in medieval and early modern sources, a thorough description of the manuscript traditions of the all-important Prester John Letter, and a brief description of Prester John in the history of cartography."}, "558": {"title": "The Thirty-Nine Steps", "bid": "558", "genre": "Adventure", "author": "Buchan, John", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XrhuzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2020-03-16", "rating": "0", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=XrhuzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Thirty-Nine+Steps&hl=&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Collector's Library", "description": "Famous as the basis for several films, including the brilliant 1935 version directed by Alfred Hitchcock, The Thirty-Nine Steps is a classic of early twentieth-century popular literature.

Other notable residents are the sexton Mr Ratsey who is friendly to John, Parson Glennie, the local clergyman who also teaches in the village school, Elzevir Block, the landlord of the local inn, called the Mohune Arms but nicknamed the Why Not? because of its sign with the Mohune 'Y', and Mr Maskew, the unpopular local magistrate and his beautiful daughter, Grace. Village legend tells of the notorious Colonel John \"Blackbeard\" Mohune who is buried in the family crypt under the church. He is reputed to have stolen a diamond from King Charles I and hidden it. His ghost is said to wander at night looking for it and the mysterious lights in the churchyard are attributed to his activities. As the main part of the story opens, Block's youthful son, David, has just been killed by Maskew during an attack by the authorities on a smuggling boat. One night a bad storm hits the village and there is a flood. While attending the Sunday service at church, John hears strange sounds from the crypt below. He thinks it is the sound of the coffins of the Mohune family. The next day, he finds Elzevir and Ratsey against the south wall of the church. They claim to be checking for damage from the storm, but John suspects they are searching for Blackbeard's ghost. Later John finds a large sinkhole has opened in the ground by a grave. He follows the passage and finds himself in the crypt with coffins on shelves and casks on the floor. He realises his friends are smugglers and this is their hiding place.

Rider Haggard. When the narrative of Holly's manuscript begins, nearly twenty years have passed since their first adventure in Africa, but he and his ward Leo Vincey are convinced that Ayesha did not die. Following their dreams, they wander for years through Asia, eventually coming to \"Thibet\" (as it is spelled in the book). Taking refuge over winter in a remote lamasery, they meet the old Abbot Kou-En, who claims to recall a past-life encounter tales with a witch queen from the time of Alexander the Great. The Abbott tries to dissuade them from going on and warns them that, however beautiful, nothing is immortal, even if the Queen was born centuries ago in Ancient Egypt or remembers it from a past life. He believes the Queen is holding on to the distractions of life, which will lead them away from Enlightenment and peace, whether she is a demon, a fallen angel, or only a dream. Despite the Abbot's warning, Leo is compelled to press on and Holly will not abandon his adopted son. When spring breaks, they travel out into the uncharted region beyond the monastery; after a perilous journey and many narrow escapes, they arrive in the city of Kaloon, which is ruled by the evil Khan Rassen and his imperious wife, the Khania Atene, who claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great's ancient Hellenist generals. The people of Kaloon live under an uneasy truce with the people who serve the Hesea, the Priestess of Hes, who dwells on the Mountain, a huge volcano that dominates the region, at the summit of which is a massive natural rock formation in the shape of an ankh. Atene declares her love for Leo, but the jealous and dissolute Rassen (who has been driven mad by the sorcery of Atene and her uncle, the wizard Simbri) wants to kill them."}, "6769": {"title": "The People of the Mist", "bid": "6769", "genre": "Adventure", "author": "Haggard, H.

Michael Gear and Kathleen O'Neal Gear take us to the Chesapeake Bay of six hundred years ago, when the unprovoked and brutal murder of a young woman on the eve of her wedding threatens to turn the entire Algonquin Nation against itself in a brutal war that could destroy them as a people. No ordinary woman, Red Knot was the heir to the Greenstone Clan and the future leader of the independent villages. Her death has shattered all alliances and left a power void that several ambitious clan chiefs see as their destiny to fill. The very air vibrates with the drums and war cries of the rallying warriors. Into the eye of this brewing storm steps the bitter old man they call The Panther. Feared as a sorcerer, The Panther is the only one with the power to demand to be heard by all. But as he digs deeper into the ever-thickening web of lies surrounding the murder, and uncovers darker, more deeply rooted secrets, he fears there may be no words to stop the impending bloodshed.

But while he was flying around the world on his private jet and hosting lavish parties at his private island in the Caribbean, he also was secretly masterminding an international child sex ring\u2014one that may have involved the richest and most influential men in the world. The conspiracy of corruption was an open secret for decades. And then this summer, it all came crashing down. After his arrest on sex trafficking charges in July, it seemed Epstein\u2019s darkest secrets would finally see the light. But hopes for true justice were shattered on August 10 this year, when he was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York. The verdict: suicide. The timing: convenient, to say the least. Now, Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales delivers bombshell new revelations, uncovers how the man President Trump once described as a \u201cterrific guy\u201d abused hundreds of underage girls at his mansions in Palm Beach and Manhattan\u2026 all while entertaining the world\u2019s most powerful men\u2014including President Clinton, Prince Andrew, and Donald Trump himself. How much did they know about his perversions? And did they take part? How might they have helped him to continue his abuse, and to escape justice for it? What responsibility might they have for his sudden, shocking death? And is there a shocking spy and blackmail story at the heart of the scandal? The answers to these questions and more will be explored in Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales with groundbreaking new reporting, never-before-seen court files, and interviews with new witnesses and confidants. Combining the very best investigative reporting from investigative journalists Dylan Howard, Melissa Cronin and James Robertson\u2014who have been covering the case for close to a decade\u2014will send shockwaves through the highest levels of the establishment."}, "12590": {"title": "The Shadow of the Rope", "bid": "12590", "genre": "Crime", "author": "Hornung, E.

Mohammed has a strong network of agents and sympathizers throughout Europe and the Middle East, and the Colombian has an equally strong drug network throughout America. What if they were to form an alliance, to combine all their assets and connections? The potential for profits would be enormous\u2014and the potential for destruction unimaginable. In the Brave New World of terrorism\u2014where anybody with a spare AK-47, a knowledge of kitchen chemistry, or simply the will to die can become a player\u2014the old rules no longer apply. No matter what new governmental organizations come into being, the only truly effective ones are those that are quick and agile, free of oversight and restrictions...and outside the system. Way outside the system. In a nondescript office building in suburban Maryland, the firm Hendley Associates does a profitable business in stocks, bonds, and international currencies, but its true mission is quite different: to identify and locate terrorist threats, and then deal with them, in whatever manner necessary. Established with the knowledge of President John Patrick Ryan, \"the Campus\" is always on the lookout for promising new talent, its recruiters scattered throughout the armed forces and government agencies\u2014and three men are about to cross its radar. The first is Dominic Caruso, a rookie FBI agent, barely a year out of Quantico, whose decisive actions resolve a particularly brutal kidnap/murder case. The second is Caruso's brother, Brian, a Marine captain just back from his first combat action in Afghanistan, and already a man to watch. And the third is their cousin...a young man named Jack Ryan, Jr. Jack was raised on intrigue. As his father moved through the ranks of the CIA and then into the White House, Jack received a life course in the world and the way it operates from agents, statesmen, analysts, Secret Service men, and black ops specialists such as John Clark and Ding Chavez. He wants to put it all to work now\u2014but when he knocks on the front door of \"the Campus,\" he finds that nothing has prepared him for what he is about to encounter. For it is indeed a different world out there, and in here...and it is about to become far more dangerous.

A contemporary of Luther, an enemy of the medical establishment, a scourge of the universities, an alchemist, an army surgeon, and a radical theologian, he attracted myths even before he died. His fantastic journeys across Europe and beyond were said to be made on a magical white horse, and he was rumored to carry the elixir of life in the pommel of his great broadsword. His name was linked with Faust, who bargained with the devil. Who was the man behind these stories? Some have accused him of being a charlatan, a windbag who filled his books with wild speculations and invented words. Others claim him as the father of modern medicine. Philip Ball exposes a more complex truth in The Devil's Doctor\u2014one that emerges only by entering into Paracelsus's time. He explores the intellectual, political, and religious undercurrents of the sixteenth century and looks at how doctors really practiced, at how people traveled, and at how wars were fought. For Paracelsus was a product of an age of change and strife, of renaissance and reformation. And yet by uniting the diverse disciplines of medicine, biology, and alchemy, he assisted, almost in spite of himself, in the birth of science and the emergence of the age of rationalism. \"Ball produces a vibrant, original portrait of a man of contradictions:\" - Publishers Weekly"}, "1182": {"title": "Dope", "bid": "1182", "genre": "Crime", "author": "Rohmer, Sax", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BuX2ckkDsvcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2007", "rating": "4.0", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=BuX2ckkDsvcC&dq=Dope&hl=&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Penguin", "description": "Entering the 1950s in the hopes that she has left her violent and drug-addicted past behind her, Josephine Flannigan takes a job helping a couple to find their missing daughter, a Barnard student who has disappeared into the subculture of heroin addiction, an assignment that forces Josephine to make a life-altering choice.

A notable figure in turn-of-the-century literary London and a friend of Conan Doyle, Barr was acutely aware of style as a form of statement and the stories are full of literary effects, commentary on the detective mystery genre, and Valmont's disparaging reflections on English values. From the hilarious satire of sensationalism in 'The Siamese Twin of a Bomb-Thrower' to the bizarre and operatic melodrama of 'The Ghost with the Club-Foot', Barr's stories delight the reader with their skill, variety, and never-abandoned sense of spirited fun.

Although the fourth and fifth mates in the seclusion of their berth ventured deeper in their search for motives, and opined that the \"old man\" had made a deal less out of this voyage than usual, the company having lately taken to providing its own stores; so that \"makings\" were gone clean and \"cumshaw\" (which means commission in the trading lingo of the China seas) had shrunk small indeed. In confirmation they adduced the uncommonly long face of the steward (the only man in the ship satisfied with the skipper), whom the new regulations hit with the same blow. But indeed the steward's dolor might well be credited to the short passenger list, and the unpromising aspect of the few passengers in the eyes of a man accustomed to gauge one's tip-yielding capacity a month in advance. For the steward it was altogether the wrong time of year, the wrong sort of voyage, and certainly the wrong sort of passengers. So that doubtless the confidential talk of the fourth and fifth officers was mere youthful scandal. At any rate, the captain had prospect of a good deal in private trade home, for he had been taking curiosities and Japanese oddments aboard (plainly for sale in London) in a way that a third steward would have been ashamed of, and which, for a captain, was a scandal and an ignominy; and he had taken pains to insure well for the lot. These things the fourth and fifth mates often spoke of, and more than once made a winking allusion to, in the presence of the third mate and the chief engineer, who laughed and winked too, and sometimes said as much to the second mate, who winked without laughing; for of such is the tittle-tattle of shipboard."}, "28071": {"title": "The Red Triangle: Being Some Further Chronicles of Martin Hewitt, Investigator", "bid": "28071", "genre": "Detective", "author": "Morrison, Arthur", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JeDCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2019-11-21", "rating": 5.0, "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JeDCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Good Press", "description": "\"The Red Triangle: Being Some Further Chronicles of Martin Hewitt, Investigator\" by Arthur Morrison.

Detective Philip Trent investigates the mysterious murder of a leading financier. Despite the title, Trent's Last Case is the first novel in which the gentleman sleuth Philip Trent appears. The novel is a whodunit with a place in detective fiction history because it is the first major sendup of that genre: Not only does Trent fall in love with one of the primary suspects\u2014usually considered a no-no\u2014he also, after painstakingly collecting all the evidence, draws all the wrong conclusions!

He studied jurisprudence at Prague and Graz, and in 1857 became a teacher at the latter university. He published several historical works, but soon gave up his academic career to devote himself wholly to literature. For a number of years he edited the international review, Auf der Hohe, at Leipzig, but later removed to Paris, for he was always strongly Francophile. His last years he spent at Lindheim in Hesse, Germany, where he died on March 9, 1895. In 1873 he married Aurora von Rumelin, who wrote a number of novels under the pseudonym of Wanda von Dunajew, which it is interesting to note is the name of the heroine of Venus in Furs. Her sensational memoirs which have been the cause of considerable controversy were published in 1906. During his career as writer an endless number of works poured from Sacher-Masoch's pen. Many of these were works of ephemeral journalism, and some of them unfortunately pure sensationalism, for economic necessity forced him to turn his pen to unworthy ends. There is, however, a residue among his works which has a distinct literary and even greater psychological value. His principal literary ambition was never completely fulfilled. It was a somewhat programmatic plan to give a picture of contemporary life in all its various aspects and interrelations under the general title of the Heritage of Cain. This idea was probably derived from Balzac's Comedie Humaine. The whole was to be divided into six subdivisions with the general titles Love, Property, Money, The State, War, and Death. Each of these divisions in its turn consisted of six novels, of which the last was intended tosummarize the author's conclusions and to present his solution for the problems set in the others. This extensive plan remained unachieved, and only the first two parts, Love_ and _Property, were completed. Of the other sections only fragments remain. The present novel, Venus in Furs, forms the fifth in the series, Love. The best of Sacher-Masoch's work is characterized by a swift narration and a graphic representation of character and scene and a rich humor. The latter has made many of his shorter stories dealing with his native Galicia little masterpieces of local color."}, "4300": {"title": "Ulysses", "bid": "4300", "genre": "Erotic", "author": "Joyce, James", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=na0bDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2016-05-04", "rating": "3.5", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=na0bDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "GENERAL PRESS", "description": "'Ulysses' is a novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was first serialised in parts in the American journal 'The Little Review' from March 1918 to December 1920, and then published in its entirety by Sylvia Beach in February 1922, in Paris. 'Ulysses' has survived bowdlerization, legal action and bitter controversy. Capturing a single day in the life of Dubliner Leopold Bloom, his friends Buck Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus, his wife Molly, and a scintillating cast of supporting characters, Joyce pushes Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. An undisputed modernist classic, its ceaseless verbal inventiveness and astonishingly wide-ranging allusions confirm its standing as an imperishable monument to the human condition. It takes readers into the inner realms of human consciousness using the interior monologue style that came to be called stream of consciousness. In addition to this psychological characteristic, it gives a realistic portrait of the life of ordinary people living in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904. The novel was the subject of a famous obscenity trial in 1933, but was found by a U.S. district court in New York to be a work of art. The furor over the novel made Joyce a celebrity. In the long run, the work placed him at the forefront of the modern period of the early 1900s when literary works, primarily in the first two decades, explored interior lives and subjective reality in a new idiom, attempting to probe the human psyche in order to understand the human condition. This richly-allusive novel, revolutionary in its modernistic experimentalism, was hailed as a work of genius by W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot and Ernest Hemingway. Scandalously frank, wittily erudite, mercurially eloquent, resourcefully comic and generously humane, 'Ulysses' offers the reader a life-changing experience.

The country was apparently tranquil. Everybody knows how the Tariff and Labour questions were settled. The war with Germany, incident on that country's seizure of the Samoan Islands, had left no visible scars upon the republic, and the temporary occupation of Norfolk by the invading army had been forgotten in the joy over repeated naval victories, and the subsequent ridiculous plight of General Von Gartenlaube's forces in the State of New Jersey. The Cuban and Hawaiian investments had paid one hundred per cent and the territory of Samoa was well worth its cost as a coaling station. The country was in a superb state of defence. Every coast city had been well supplied with land fortifications; the army under the parental eye of the General Staff, organized according to the Prussian system, had been increased to 300,000 men, with a territorial reserve of a million; and six magnificent squadrons of cruisers and battle-ships patrolled the six stations of the navigable seas, leaving a steam reserve amply fitted to control home waters. The gentlemen from the West had at last been constrained to acknowledge that a college for the training of diplomats was as necessary as law schools are for the training of barristers; consequently we were no longer represented abroad by incompetent patriots. The nation was prosperous; Chicago, for a moment paralyzed after a second great fire, had risen from its ruins, white and imperial, and more beautiful than the white city which had been built for its plaything in 1893. Everywhere good architecture was replacing bad, and even in New York, a sudden craving for decency had swept away a great portion of the existing horrors. Streets had been widened, properly paved and lighted, trees had been planted, squares laid out, elevated structures demolished and underground roads built to replace them. The new government buildings and barracks were fine bits of architecture, and the long system of stone quays which completely surrounded the island had been turned into parks which proved a god-send to the population. The subsidizing of the state theatre and state opera brought its own reward. The United States National Academy of Design was much like European institutions of the same kind. Nobody envied the Secretary of Fine Arts, either his cabinet position or his portfolio. The Secretary of Forestry and Game Preservation had a much easier time, thanks to the new system of National Mounted Police. We had profited well by the latest treaties with France and England; the exclusion of foreign-born Jews as a measure of self-preservation, the settlement of the new independent negro state of Suanee, the checking of immigration, the new laws concerning naturalization, and the gradual centralization of power in the executive all contributed to national calm and prosperity. When the Government solved the Indian problem and squadrons of Indian cavalry scouts in native costume were substituted for the pitiable organizations tacked on to the tail of skeletonized regiments by a former Secretary of War, the nation drew a long sigh of relief. When, after the colossal Congress of Religions, bigotry and intolerance were laid in their graves and kindness and charity began to draw warring sects together, many thought the millennium had arrived, at least in the new world which after all is a world by itself."}, "14107": {"title": "The Lost Stradivarius", "bid": "14107", "genre": "Horror", "author": "Falkner, John Meade", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EgLDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2019-11-20", "rating": 2.0, "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EgLDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Good Press", "description": "\"The Lost Stradivarius\" by John Meade Falkner.

Rain is responsible for a great deal more than the mere growth of vegetables--it is a controller, if a somewhat capricious controller, of man's destiny. It was mainly, if not entirely, owing to rain that the French lost the Battle of Agincourt; whilst, if I mistake not, Confucius alone knows how many victories have been snatched from the Chinese by the same factor. It was most certainly rain that drove Leon Hamar to take refuge in a second-hand bookshop; for so deep-rooted was his aversion to any literature saving a financial gazette or the stock and shares column of a daily, that nothing would have induced him to get within touching distance of a book save the risk of a severe wetting. Now, to his unutterable disgust, he found himself surrounded by the things he loathed. Books ancient--very ancient, judging by their bindings--and modern--histories, biographies, novels and magazines--anything from ten dollars to five cents, and all arrayed with most laudable tact according to their bulk and condition. But Hamar was neither to be tempted nor mollified. He frowned at one and all alike, and the colossal edition of Miss Somebody or Other's poems--that by reason of its magnificent cover of crimson and gold occupied a most prominent position--met with the same vindictive reception as the tattered and torn volumes of Whittier stowed away in an obscure corner. Backing still further into the entrance of the store for a better protection from the rain, which, now falling heavier and heavier, was blown in by the wind, Hamar collided with a stand of books, with the result that one of them fell with a loud bang on the pavement. A man, evidently the owner of the store, and unmistakably a Jew, instantly appeared. Picking up the book, and wiping it with a dirty handkerchief, he thrust it at Hamar... Chapter II. Chapter III.

Now in Widdershins, a stand-alone novel of fairy courts set in shopping malls and the Bohemian street scene of Newford's Crowsea area, Jilly and Geordie's story is finally being told. Before it's over, we'll find ourselves plunged into the rancorous and sometimes violent conflict between the magical North American \"animal people\" and the more newly-arrived fairy folk.

In addition, a new retranslation back into English of Mallarm\u00e9's text, which was both praised and criticized for its literalism, reveals the particular tenor and subtleties of his reading of Poe's verse and his feel, as a fellow poet, for the emotive and evocative power of language.

It is in such a wise that memory plays its pranks for good or ill; for pleasure or pain; for weal or woe. It is thus that life is bittersweet, and that which has been done becomes eternal. Again, the light skiff, ceasing to shoot through the lazy water as when the oars flashed and dripped, glided out of the fierce July sunlight into the cool shade of the great drooping willow branches - I standing up in the swaying boat, she sitting still and with deft fingers guarding herself from stray twigs or the freedom of the resilience of moving boughs. Again, the water looked golden-brown under the canopy of translucent green; and the grassy bank was of emerald hue. Again, we sat in the cool shade, with the myriad noises of nature both without and within our bower merging into that drowsy hum in whose sufficing environment the great world with its disturbing trouble, and its more disturbing joys, can be effectually forgotten. Again, in that blissful solitude the young girl lost the convention of her prim, narrow upbringing, and told me in a natural, dreamy way of the loneliness of her new life. With an undertone of sadness she made m e feel how in that spacious home each one of the household was isolated by the personal magnificence of her father and herself; that there confidence hadno altar, and sympathy no shrine; and that there even her father's face was as distant as the old country life seemed now.

You are probably already a Man (with a capital M)! But if youre under age fifty, theres a good chance that youre lost and feel pushed around. Wracked by doubt (especially in regard to women), you may not know what to do unless someone pushes youand even then, you may resent the push. To discover whether you are a Man start by asking: Am I happy with who I am and where I am going? Do I know where I am going and how to get there? Am I standing in my power as a Man in my relationships? Am I realizing my full social, intellectual, and sexual potential? This book puts into words what it means to be a Man. Its not prescriptive, nebulous, or scientific. Its not so technical that you will be unable to decipher its meaning. It highlights the skills, qualities, and traits of a Man and does so in plain English. Shake off self-doubt, stop blaming others for problems, and become the Man youre meant to be with The Man Book."}, "17144": {"title": "The House of the Vampire", "bid": "17144", "genre": "Horror", "author": "Viereck, George Sylvester", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GLXCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2019-11-19", "rating": 4.0, "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GLXCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Good Press", "description": "\"The House of the Vampire\" by George Sylvester Viereck.

His verdict: \"The theories contained in this new work . . . are novel, very original and indubitably important. Whether they are true, I do not know. As a logician who likes simplicity, I should like to think that they are not, but from what I have read of them I am quite sure that he ought to have an opportunity to work them out, since, when completed, they may easily prove to constitute a whole new philosophy.\" \"[Philosophical Remarks] contains the seeds of Wittgenstein's later philosophy of mind and of mathematics. Principally, he here discusses the role of indispensable in language, criticizing Russell's The Analysis of Mind. He modifies the Tractatus's picture theory of meaning by stressing that the connection between the proposition and reality is not found in the picture itself. He analyzes generality in and out of mathematics, and the notions of proof and experiment. He formulates a pain/private-language argument and discusses both behaviorism and the verifiability principle. The work is difficult but important, and it belongs in every philosophy collection.\"\u2014Robert Hoffman, Philosophy \"Any serious student of Wittgenstein's work will want to study his Philosophical Remarks as a transitional book between his two great masterpieces. The Remarks is thus indispensible for anyone who seeks a complete understanding of Wittgenstein's philosophy.\"\u2014Leonard Linsky, American Philosophical Association"}, "23783": {"title": "Eliza", "bid": "23783", "genre": "Humor", "author": "Pain, Barry", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eC17DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2018", "rating": 3.0, "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=eC17DwAAQBAJ&dq=Eliza&hl=&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Schwartz & Wade Books", "description": "Presents the life of Eliza Hamilton, wife of founding father Alexander Hamilton, covering her early years in New York, her married life with Alexander, and her later years as a generous philanthropist."}, "13993": {"title": "Dere Mable: Love Letters of a Rookie", "bid": "13993", "genre": "Humor", "author": "Streeter, Edward", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BesRAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "1918", "rating": "0", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BesRAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "empty", "description": "Description not available..."}, "15758": {"title": "\"Same old Bill, eh Mable!\"", "bid": "15758", "genre": "Humor", "author": "Streeter, Edward", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kd4_AAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "1919", "rating": "0", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kd4_AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Read Books Ltd", "description": "A World War I soldier writes home to his wife Mabel in a series of humorous letters about his military experiences in France."}, "7471": {"title": "The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories", "bid": "7471", "genre": "Humor", "author": "Wodehouse, P.

As the pounds melt away and she begins to feel more comfortable in her own skin, Ellen\u2019s cousin prompts the former writer to enter a blog competition. At first Ellen is hesitant; after all, what exactly is she supposed to write about? But soon the words start flowing and Ellen gains confidence, in part because of the attention she\u2019s getting from her cousin\u2019s new neighbor, handsome detective Ben Campbell. Both Ellen and Ben are married with kids, and they know their friendship is heading down a dangerous path. As her attraction to Ben grows and her blog starts attracting a lot of interest, everything else in Ellen\u2019s world begins to unravel. Now, she finds herself wondering if the life she has is what she really wants, or if something new is exactly what she needs\u2026"}, "7050": {"title": "The Swoop! or, How Clarence Saved England: A Tale of the Great Invasion", "bid": "7050", "genre": "Humor", "author": "Wodehouse, P.

A number of the definitions are accompanied by satiric verses, many of which are signed with comic pseudonyms. It offers reinterpretations of terms in the English language which lampoon cant and political double-talk as well as other aspects of human foolishness and frailty.

Now the acclaimed author turns to World War I, bringing to life the sweeping, emotional story of the war that devastated a generation and established America as a world power. Spring 1916: the horror of a stalemate on Europe\u2019s western front. France and Great Britain are on one side of the barbed wire, a fierce German army is on the other. Shaara opens the window onto the otherworldly tableau of trench warfare as seen through the eyes of a typical British soldier who experiences the bizarre and the horrible\u2013a \u201cTommy\u201d whose innocent youth is cast into the hell of a terrifying war. In the skies, meanwhile, technology has provided a devastating new tool, the aeroplane, and with it a different kind of hero emerges\u2013the flying ace. Soaring high above the chaos on the ground, these solitary knights duel in the splendor and terror of the skies, their courage and steel tested with every flight. As the conflict stretches into its third year, a neutral America is goaded into war, its reluctant president, Woodrow Wilson, finally accepting the repeated challenges to his stance of nonalignment. Yet the Americans are woefully unprepared and ill equipped to enter a war that has become worldwide in scope. The responsibility is placed on the shoulders of General John \u201cBlackjack\u201d Pershing, and by mid-1917 the first wave of the American Expeditionary Force arrives in Europe. Encouraged by the bold spirit and strength of the untested Americans, the world waits to see if the tide of war can finally be turned. From Blackjack Pershing to the Marine in the trenches, from the Red Baron to the American pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille, To the Last Man is written with the moving vividness and accuracy that characterizes all of Shaara\u2019s work. This spellbinding new novel carries readers\u2013the way only Shaara can\u2013to the heart of one of the greatest conflicts in human history, and puts them face-to-face with the characters who made a lasting impact on the world."}, "2066": {"title": "Wildfire", "bid": "2066", "genre": "Western", "author": "Grey, Zane", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W7WADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2019-09-03", "rating": "4.5", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W7WADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Scholastic Inc.", "description": "Newbery Honor author Rodman Philbrick sends readers straight into the nightmare of a raging wildfire as 12-year-old Sam is trapped by explosive flames and deadly smoke that threaten to take his life.

Drew Rennie is a rebel in more ways than one. Since childhood, he has defied the stern, unforgiving grandfather who reared him and who made no secret of his hatred for Drew\u2019s Texan father. And when the Civil War began, Grandfather\u2019s sympathies with the North, the smoldering feud erupted into a violent quarrel. Now, eighteen-year-old Drew has returned to Kentucky with Morgan\u2019s Raiders, a seasoned veteran with two years of experience fighting for the South. And even though Morgan\u2019s disastrous defeat at Cynthiana clearly reflects the Confederacy\u2019s growing weakness, it never occurs to Drew, his spur-jingling friend Anse Kirby, or young Boyd Barrett to stop fighting. In disorder, without adequate supplies and weapons, and harried by Union soldiers, they battle their way south to join Forrest\u2019s army. Ride Proud, Rebel! is the dramatic story of the long, agonizing retreat of the Army of the Tennessee from Harrisburg, Mississippi, where Boyd was wounded, to the rout of Selma and final surrender. Based on unpublished sources and written by a master storyteller, Drew\u2019s adventures as a scout for Forrest during the last year of the Confederacy make not only a gripping tale but also graphically portray the courage and strength of men who met defeat with honor.

Coetzee. J.M. Coetzee's latest novel, The Schooldays of Jesus, will soon be available from Viking. For decades the Magistrate has been a loyal servant of the Empire, running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement and ignoring the impending war with the barbarians. When interrogation experts arrive, however, he witnesses the Empire's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war. Jolted into sympathy for their victims, he commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state. J. M. Coetzee's prize-winning novel is a startling allegory of the war between opressor and opressed. The Magistrate is not simply a man living through a crisis of conscience in an obscure place in remote times; his situation is that of all men living in unbearable complicity with regimes that ignore justice and decency.

The Hugo Awards, named after pioneer science-fiction publisher Hugo Gernsback, and voted on by members of the World Science Fiction Society, have been presented since 1953. They are widely considered the most prestigious awards in science fiction. Between 2010 and 2013, Jo Walton wrote a series of posts for Tor.com, surveying the Hugo finalists and winners from the award's inception up to the year 2000. Her contention was that each year's full set of finalists generally tells a meaningful story about the state of science fiction at that time. Walton's cheerfully opinionated and vastly well-informed posts provoked valuable conversation among the field's historians. Now these posts, lightly revised, have been gathered into this book, along with a small selection of the comments posted by SF luminaries such as Rich Horton, Gardner Dozois, and David G. Hartwell. \"A remarkable guided tour through the field\u2014a kind of nonfiction companion to Among Others. It's very good.

From the time he learnt to move pieces on a chessboard as a six-year-old, Vishy ? as Anand is fondly called ? has racked up innumerable accolades. The first World Chess Champion from Asia, he emerged on to the world stage when chess was largely a Soviet preserve, climbed the ranks to become World No. 1, bagged five World Championship titles and won tournaments across all formats of the game. A peerless ambassador of chess, his is one of the most revered names in the sport. In Mind Master, Vishy looks back on a lifetime of games played, opponents tackled and circumstances overcome, and draws from its depths significant tools that will help every reader navigate life?s challenges: What role do tactics and strategy play in the preparation for achieving a goal? How can emotions be harnessed to your advantage in tricky situations? What precautions should you take before you decide to leave your comfort zone and embrace risk? What do you need to do to stay relevant in the face of rapidly changing realities? Is unlearning really the only way to learn? These are just some of the nuggets Vishy touches upon with characteristic wit, easy wisdom and disarming candour in Mind Master ? a delightful and invaluable exploration into the self that will thrill, inspire and motivate readers as few books have done before."}, "62": {"title": "A Princess of Mars", "bid": "62", "genre": "Science", "author": "Burroughs, Edgar Rice", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ws18cmj5ic0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "1917", "rating": "4.0", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ws18cmj5ic0C&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Library of America", "description": "A Princess of Mars is the first tale in the classic Martian novel series of Edgar Rice Burroughs.

The rise of manufacturing could not have happened without an attention to precision. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century England, standards of measurement were established, giving way to the development of machine tools\u2014machines that make machines. Eventually, the application of precision tools and methods resulted in the creation and mass production of items from guns and glass to mirrors, lenses, and cameras\u2014and eventually gave way to further breakthroughs, including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider. Simon Winchester takes us back to origins of the Industrial Age, to England where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson who later exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States, setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. Winchester moves forward through time, to today\u2019s cutting-edge developments occurring around the world, from America to Western Europe to Asia. As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?"}, "29632": {"title": "Competition", "bid": "29632", "genre": "Science", "author": "Causey, James", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=58BaPqkbYZAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2008-10-01", "rating": "4.0", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=58BaPqkbYZAC&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Harvard Business Press", "description": "For the past two decades, Michael Porter's work has towered over the field of competitive strategy. On Competition, Updated and Expanded Edition brings together more than a dozen of Porter's landmark articles from the Harvard Business Review. Five are new to this edition, including the 2008 update to his classic \"The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy,\" as well as new work on health care, philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, and CEO leadership. This collection captures Porter's unique ability to bridge theory and practice. Each of the articles has not only shaped thinking, but also redefined the work of practitioners in its respective field. In an insightful new introduction, Porter relates each article to the whole of his thinking about competition and value creation, and traces how that thinking has deepened over time. This collection is organized by topic, allowing the reader easy access to the wide range of Porter's work. Parts I and II present the frameworks for which Porter is best known--frameworks that address how companies, as well as nations and regions, gain and sustain competitive advantage. Part III shows how strategic thinking can address society's most pressing challenges, from environmental sustainability to improving health-care delivery. Part IV explores how both nonprofits and corporations can create value for society more effectively by applying strategy principles to philanthropy. Part V explores the link between strategy and leadership."}, "40970": {"title": "Exploiter's End", "bid": "40970", "genre": "Science", "author": "Causey, James", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PnCazAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2019-12-08", "rating": "0", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=PnCazAEACAAJ&dq=Exploiter%27s+End&hl=&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "MIT Press", "description": "NWO Editions has the goal of making available to readers the classic books that have been out of print for decades.

Reginald Dwayne Betts confronts the funk of postincarceration existence and examines prison not as a static space, but as a force that enacts pressure throughout a person\u2019s life. The poems move between traditional and newfound forms with power and agility\u2014from revolutionary found poems created by redacting court documents to the astonishing crown of sonnets that serves as the volume\u2019s radiant conclusion. Drawing inspiration from lawsuits filed on behalf of the incarcerated, the redaction poems focus on the ways we exploit and erase the poor and imprisoned from public consciousness. Traditionally, redaction erases what is top secret; in Felon, Betts redacts what is superfluous, bringing into focus the profound failures of the criminal justice system and the inadequacy of the labels it generates. Challenging the complexities of language, Betts animates what it means to be a \"felon.\""}, "29625": {"title": "Teething Ring", "bid": "29625", "genre": "Science", "author": "Causey, James", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5x7goQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2014-10-02", "rating": "0", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=5x7goQEACAAJ&dq=Teething+Ring&hl=&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "CreateSpace", "description": "This collection of literature attempts to compile many of the classic works that have stood the test of time and offer them at a reduced, affordable price, in an attractive volume so that everyone can enjoy them."}, "18668": {"title": "In Search of the Unknown", "bid": "18668", "genre": "Science", "author": "Chambers, Robert W.

How we farm, what we eat, and how our food gets to the table all have an impact. And our government and the food industry are willfully ignoring the issue rather than addressing it. In Anna Lapp\u00e9's controversial new book, she predicts that unless we radically shift the trends of what food we're eating and how we're producing it, food system-related greenhouse gas emissions will go up and up and up. She exposes the interests that will resist the change, and the spin food companies will generate to avoid system-wide reform. And she offers a vision of a future in which our food system does more good than harm, with six principles for a climate friendly diet as well as visits to farmers who are demonstrating the potential of sustainable farming.

But there was no sign that anyone had been trying to rob him of his bindle or the precious bag of cheap tobacco.

When she starts to see strange visions of a boy she\u2019s never spoken with in real life, she begins to suspect that there\u2019s much about her past that she isn\u2019t being told. Tavia immediately searches for answers, desperate to determine why she feels so drawn to a boy she hardly knows.

Living in a house that was crumbling around their ears, she reveals how her family hid a Republican who was later hanged, how she tested herself (with hot water) to increase her pain threshold, how she avoided an insane and shrieking maid, who was convinced that Dervla's parents were fried eggs, and how she helped another maid give birth under the kitchen table."}, "28554": {"title": "Beyond Lies the Wub", "bid": "28554", "genre": "Science", "author": "Dick, Philip K.", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ErxmCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2016-01-18", "rating": "0", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ErxmCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Read Books Ltd", "description": "This early work by Philip K.

His autobiographical novella Trepanation of the Skull is a portrait of the artist as a young late-Soviet man. At the center of the narrative are Gandlevsky's brain tumor, surgery, and recovery in the early 1990s. The story radiates out, relaying the poet's personal history through 1994, including his unique perspective on the 1991 coup by Communist hardliners resisted by Boris Yeltsin. Gandlevsky tells wonderfully strange but true episodes from the bohemian life he and his literary companions led. He also frankly describes his epic alcoholism and his ambivalent adjustment to marriage and fatherhood. Aside from its documentary interest, the book's appeal derives from its self-critical and shockingly honest narrator, who expresses himself in the densely stylized version of Moscow slang that was characteristic of the nonconformist intelligentsia of the 1970s and 1980s. Gandlevsky is a true artist of language who incorporates into his style the cadences of Pushkin and Tiutchev, the folk wisdom of proverbs, and slang in all its varieties. Susanne Fusso's excellent translation marks the first volume in English of Sergey Gandlevsky's prose, and it will interest scholars, students, and general readers of Russian literature and culture of the late Soviet and post-Soviet periods."}, "40964": {"title": "Tony and the Beetles", "bid": "40964", "genre": "Science", "author": "Dick, Philip K.", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D7tmCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2016-01-15", "rating": "0", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D7tmCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Read Books Ltd", "description": "This early work by Philip K.

Her ancient rage returns, along with the memory of a promise she made long ago -- when her name was Artemis. Jordanna Max Brodsky's acclaimed debut sets Greek Gods against a modern Manhattan backdrop, creating an unputdownable blend of myth and mystery.

His reason: the war was a senseless slaughter. He was officially classified \"mentally unsound\" and sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital. There a brilliant psychiatrist, Dr. William Rivers, set about restoring Sassoon's \"sanity\" and sending him back to the trenches. This novel tells what happened as only a novel can. It is a war saga in which not a shot is fired. It is a story of a battle for a man's mind in which only the reader can decide who is the victor, who the vanquished, and who the victim. One of the most amazing feats of fiction of our time, Regneration has been hailed by critics across the globe.

In her youth, she started out as Kissia descendent of African slaves, living in Wilsons Mill, North Carolina. Her upbringing brought her face-to-face with racism and discrimination, both subtly and overtly. The lines dividing black and white fascinated young Kissi; as she grew up, she decided to take a deeper look at race relations, nationwide. Blessed Are the Meek, the Humble, and the Bold is the memoir of Dr. Elsie Collins, a woman who spent nearly three-quarters of the twentieth century cutting through the color divide. Although she met with many challenges, Elsie never gave up on goals she had set for herself and her community. She never gave up on building strong relationships across lines of class, race, and culture. Elsie Collins has inspired hundreds on her long journey to personal freedom and success, from small towns in North Carolina to the big city of New York. Through the acquisition of knowledge, friendship, wisdom, she developed the judgment to discern when to be humble and when to be bold. Her story is a snapshot of race relations in America and a commentary on the insignificance of skin color in human relationships and in the search for the meaning of life."}, "50835": {"title": "The Luckiest Man in Denv", "bid": "50835", "genre": "Science", "author": "Kornbluth, C.

The Road to Science Fiction is a six-volume anthology that covers the development of this genre from its earliest prototypes to the current day. Created originally to provide anthologies for use in classrooms in the late 1970s, these volumes became mass-market sellers. Between an ancient Roman's trip to the moon and the fantastic tales of H.G. Wells lies a journey through time and space and an awesome evolution in scientific thinking. From Gilgamesh's search for immortality to Edgar Allan Poe's balloon trip in the year 2848 these and other key works are gathered together for the first time in one anthology, complete with revealing commentary on the authors, their eras, and the role each played in establishing what we today recognize as science fiction. Volume 4 From Here to Forever covers the period from 1950-1992, illustrating how science fiction can be as concerned with language and character as much as traditional fiction and anything in the mainstream. Includes stories by Jorge Luis Borges, Richard Matheson, C. M.

Like an excrescence on the flank of Mother Earth herself, the mound loomed; like an unhealthy, cancerous growth. And inside the enigmatic thing was another world. A dark world, mysterious, horrible, peopled by blind and terrible demons--a world like a Dante's dream of a second Inferno. Such, at least, were the thoughts of Dennis Braymer as he worked with delicate care at the task of sawing into the hard cement of a portion of the wall near the rounded top. His eyes, dark brown and rimmed with thick black lashes, flashed earnestly behind his glasses as they concentrated on his difficult job. His face, lean and tanned, was a mask of seriousness. To him, obviously, this was a task of vital importance; a task worthy of all a man's ability of brain and logic.

Over nearly two centuries, the Mexican victory over an outnumbered band of Alamo defenders has been transformed into an American victory for the love of liberty. Why did the historical battle of 1836 undergo this metamorphosis in memory and mythology to become such a potent master symbol in Texan and American culture? In this probing book, Richard Flores seeks to answer that question by examining how the Alamo's transformation into an American cultural icon helped to shape social, economic, and political relations between Anglo and Mexican Texans from the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries. In the first part of the book, he looks at how the attempts of heritage society members and political leaders to define the Alamo as a place have reflected struggles within Texas society over the place and status of Anglos and Mexicans. In the second part, he explores how Alamo movies and the transformation of Davy Crockett into an Alamo hero/martyr have advanced deeply racialized, ambiguous, and even invented understandings of the past."}, "29140": {"title": "The Mathematicians", "bid": "29140", "genre": "Science", "author": "Feldman, Arthur", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rvTguQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2018", "rating": 4.0, "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=rvTguQEACAAJ&dq=The+Mathematicians&hl=&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "American Mathematical Soc.", "description": "Photographs accompanied by autobiographical text written by each mathematician."}, "23535": {"title": "The Invaders", "bid": "23535", "genre": "Science", "author": "Ferris, Benjamin", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=daLLBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2015", "rating": "4.0", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=daLLBgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Invaders&hl=&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Harvard University Press", "description": "Humans domesticated dogs soon after Neanderthals began to disappear.

But now, Noah Feldman argues, we are entering an era of renewed global struggle: the era of Cool War. Just as the Cold War matched the planet's reigning superpowers in a contest for geopolitical supremacy, so this new age will pit the United States against a rising China in a contest for dominance, alliances, and resources. Already visible in Asia, the conflict will extend to the Middle East (U.S.-backed Israel versus Chinese-backed Iran), Africa, and beyond. Yet this Cool War differs fundamentally from the zero-sum showdowns of the past: The world's major power and its leading challenger are economically interdependent to an unprecedented degree. Exports to the U.S. account for nearly a quarter of Chinese trade, while the Chinese government holds 8 percent of America's outstanding debt. This positive-sum interdependence has profound implications for nations, corporations, and international institutions. It makes what looked to be a classic contest between two great powers into something much more complex, contradictory, and badly in need of the shrewd and carefully reasoned analysis that Feldman provides. To understand the looming competition with China, we must understand the incentives that drive Chinese policy. Feldman offers an arresting take on that country's secretive hierarchy, proposing that the hereditary \"princelings\" who reap the benefits of the complicated Chinese political system are actually in partnership with the meritocrats who keep the system full of fresh talent and the reformers who are trying to root out corruption and foster government accountability. He provides a clear-eyed analysis of the years ahead, showing how China's rise presents opportunities as well as risks. Robust competition could make the U.S. leaner, smarter, and more pragmatic, and could drive China to greater respect for human rights. Alternatively, disputes over trade, territory, or human rights could jeopardize the global economic equilibrium--or provoke a catastrophic \"hot war\" that neither country wants. The U.S. and China may be divided by political culture and belief, but they are also bound together by mutual self-interest. Cool War makes the case for competitive cooperation as the only way forward that can preserve the peace and make winners out of both sides.

They endured heat and cold, rain and drought, despair and loneliness to fulfill their calling They traveled from town to farm to stage-stop to anywhere people had settled, preaching the Gospel. These saddlebag-preachers spoke to anyone who would listen. They were rugged individuals who allowed neither rough terrain nor menacing weather to sway them from their appointed areas of service. These unsung heroes of the West helped bring true civilization to the American frontier. There would be little or no reward beyond the spiritual. This book is a fictionalized story of three such country preachers on the frontier of Texas and the problems they faced bringing the message of Christ to wilderness areas. Bill Wood was born and raised in a small town in Texas. Since 1975, he has pastored ten country churches in either Texas, Louisiana, or California or taught in a small Christian school... or both at the same time. When not preaching or studying or writing, Bro. Bill enjoys visiting antique stores, festivals, and historical places. He's been known to pick and grin some in church and is partial to anything having to do with the Old West (movies, artwork, decor, clothes, rodeos). Dr. Wood has been described by friends as \"an old-fashioned, Southern gentleman with just a touch of John Wayne.\" In May of 2012, he became the pastor at Central Baptist Church in Stamford, Texas. A graduate of Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and Baptist Christian University in Shreveport, Louisiana, this is Bill's second book to be published through Xulon Press... the first being a fictional account of the birth of Jesus entitled \"And Nothing's Been the Same Since.\""}, "29046": {"title": "The Heads of Apex", "bid": "29046", "genre": "Science", "author": "Weiss, George Henry", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4bGRtQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2017-11-10", "rating": "0", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4bGRtQEACAAJ&dq=The+Heads+of+Apex&hl=&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Createspace Independent Publishing Platform", "description": "Far under the sea-floor Solino's submarine carries two American soldiers of fortune to startling adventure among the Vampire Heads of Apex."}, "23831": {"title": "The Seed of the Toc-Toc Birds", "bid": "23831", "genre": "Science", "author": "Weiss, George Henry", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=utJRDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2018-04-05", "rating": "0", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=utJRDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Seed+of+the+Toc-Toc+Birds&hl=&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "BoD \u2013 Books on Demand", "description": "Reproduction of the original: The Seed of the Toc-Toc Birds by Francis Flagg"}, "5965": {"title": "The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix", "bid": "5965", "genre": "Science", "author": "Flint, Homer Eon", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z-HCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2019-12-06", "rating": "0", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z-HCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Good Press", "description": "\"The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix\" by Homer Eon Flint.

Then the inexplicable happened: he was disqualified after arriving seconds late for a quarterfinal heat. Ten years of training to become the \"World's Fastest Human,\" the title attached to an Olympic 100-meter champion, was lost in a heartbeat. But who was to blame? Hart's disappointment, though excruciating, was just one of many subplots to the most tragic of Olympic Games, at which eight Arab terrorists assassinated eleven Israeli athletes and coaches as the world watched in horror. Five terrorists were killed, but three escaped to their homeland as heroes and were never brought to trial. Swimmer Mark Spitz won seven gold medals but was rushed out of Germany afterward because he was Jewish. Other American athletes, besides Hart, seemed jinxed in Munich. The USA men's basketball team thought it had earned the gold medal, but the Russians received it instead through an unprecedented technicality. Bob Seagren, the defending pole vault champion, was barred from using his poles and forced to compete with unfamiliar poles. And swimmer Rick DeMont lost one gold medal and the possibility of winning a second because of an allergy drug that had passed U.S. Olympic Committee specifications but was disallowed by the International Olympic Committee. It was that kind of Olympics, confusing to some, fatal to others. Hart traveled back to Munich forty-three years later to relive his utter disappointment. He returned to the same stadium where he did earn a gold medal in the 400-meter relay. In Disqualified, his interesting life story, told with author Dave Newhouse, sheds entirely new light on what really happened at Munich. It includes interviews with Spitz and the victimized American athletes and conversations with two Israelis who escaped the terrorists.

But what distinguishes wind engineering in urban areas from conventional wind engineering? Principally, the fact that the effects studied are usually unique to a particular situation, requiring consideration of the surroundings of the buildings. In the past, modelling criteria have been developed that make it possible to solve environmental problems with great confidence, and studies validated the models: at least in a neutrally stratified atmosphere. The approach adopted in the book is that of applied fluid mechanics, since this forms the basis for the evaluation of the urban wind field. Variables for air quality or loads are problem specific, or even random, and methods for studying them are based on risk analysis, which is also presented. Criteria are developed for a systematic approach to urban wind engineering problems, including parameter studies. The five sections of the book are: Fundamentals of urban boundary layer and dispersion; Forces on complex structures in built-up areas; Air pollution in cities; Numerical solution techniques; and Posters.

The staid and stolid minds that run the companies which design and build spaceships rarely let their minds run to fancy. The only example I can think of is the unsung hero of the last century who had puckish imagination enough to name the first atomic-powered submarine Nautilus. Such minds are rare. Most minds equate dignity with dullness. This ship happened to have a magnetogravitic drive, which automatically put it into the MG class. It also happened to be the first successful model to be equipped with a Yale robotic brain, so it was given the designation MG-YR-7--the first six had had more bugs in them than a Leopoldville tenement. So somebody at Yale--another unsung hero--named the ship McGuire; it wasn't official, but it stuck. The next step was to get someone to test-hop McGuire. They needed just the right man--quick-minded, tough, imaginative, and a whole slew of complementary adjectives.

At first Donatti\u2019s too concerned with his own survival to look a gift genie in the mouth, but when his ex-girlfriend Jazz and her young son get drawn into the crossfire, the stakes skyrocket. And when Ian reveals that he has an agenda of his own\u2014with both Donatti and the murderous Trevor at the center of it\u2014Donatti will have to become the man he never knew he could be, or the entire world could pay the price. . . ."}, "22585": {"title": "\u2014And Devious the Line of Duty", "bid": "22585", "genre": "Science", "author": "Godwin, Tom", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1WatcLUN4lcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2010-10-01", "rating": 3.0, "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1WatcLUN4lcC&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "eStar Books", "description": "Sometimes the most diligent and loyal thing an old man can do is fumble, drink beer, and let a young man get into trouble...."}, "23799": {"title": "Cry from a Far Planet", "bid": "23799", "genre": "Science", "author": "Godwin, Tom", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RLR5BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "1958-08-18", "rating": "0", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=RLR5BQAAQBAJ&dq=Cry+from+a+Far+Planet&hl=&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Best Classic Books", "description": "The problem of separating the friends from the enemies was a major one in the conquest of space as many a dead spacer could have testified.

ExcerptThe war game around the Canal was planned for more than practice, however. The eyes of the whole world were on that array of America's ocean might--the eyes of one foreign nation in particular. Washington knew of the policies of that nation, and wished to impress upon is the hopelessness of them. More than a game, this concentration of sea and air-borne fighting power was a gesture for the continued peace of the world--a gesture strong with the hint of steel.Chris Travers was vaguely aware, through the rumors of the mess-room, of the double meaning of the game he was playing his part in, but this morning he didn't give a single thought. He was too wrapped up in his job of spotting the van of the Black Fleet, radio-telephoning latitude and longitude to the bridge of the Blue Fleet flagship, and getting home to his dirigible without being declared destroyed by one of the war game umpires.Therefore, half an hour later, his heart thrilled as he glimpsed, wraith-like on the steely horizon, a wisp of smoke."}, "27464": {"title": "A Scientist Rises", "bid": "27464", "genre": "Science", "author": "Hall, Desmond Winter", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5CFoR_qcX_UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2011-05-01", "rating": "0", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5CFoR_qcX_UC&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "eStar Books", "description": "All gazed, transfixed, at the vast form that towered above them. Excerpt \"\"The face of the giant was indeed that of a god....\"\"On that summer day the sky over New York was unflecked by clouds, and the air hung motionless, the waves of heat undisturbed. The city was a vast oven where even the sounds of the coiling traffic in its streets seemed heavy and weary under the press of heat that poured down from above. In Washington Square, the urchins of the neighborhood splashed in the fountain, and the usual midday assortment of mothers, tramps and out-of-works lounged listlessly on the hot park benches.As a bowl, the Square was filled by the torrid sun, and the trees and grass drooped like the people on its walks. In the surrounding city, men worked in sweltering offices and the streets rumbled with the never-ceasing tide of business--but Washington Square rested.And then a man walked out of one of the houses lining the square, and all this was changed.He came with a calm, steady stride down the steps of a house on the north side, and those who happened to see him gazed with surprised interest. For he was a giant in size. He measured at least eleven feet in height, and his body was well-formed and in perfect proportion. He crossed the street and stepped over the railing into the nearest patch of grass, and there stood with arms folded and legs a little apart. The expression on his face was preoccupied and strangely apart, nor did it change when, almost immediately from the park bench nearest him, a woman's excited voice cried: \"\"Look! Look! Oh, look!\"\"The people around her craned their necks and stared, and from them grew a startled murmur. Others from farther away came to see who had cried out, and remained to gaze fascinated at the man on the grass. Quickly the murmur spread across the Square, and from its every part men and women and children streamed towards the center of interest--and then, when they saw, backed away slowly and fearfully, with staring eyes, from where the lone figure stood."}, "32847": {"title": "The Door into Infinity", "bid": "32847", "genre": "Science", "author": "Hamilton, Edmond", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ePV4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "publishDate": "2017-12-20", "rating": "3.0", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ePV4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "publisher": "Jovian Press", "description": "An amazing weird mystery story, packed with thrills, danger and startling events.
