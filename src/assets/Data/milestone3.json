The first London edition of the Memoirs in 1894 did not include \"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\", although all twelve stories had appeared in the Strand Magazine. The first U.S. edition did include the story, but it was very quickly replaced with a revised edition that omitted it. The reasoning behind the suppression is unclear. In Britain the story was apparently removed at Doyle's request as it included adultery and so was unsuitable for younger readers. This may have also been the cause for the rapid removal of the story from the U.S. edition, and some sources[specify] state that the publishers believed the story was too scandalous for the American public. As a result, this story was not republished in the U.S. until many years later, when it was added to His Last Bow. Even today, most American editions of the canon include it with His Last Bow, while most British editions keep the story in its original place in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Additionally, when the story was removed from the Memoirs, its opening pages, where Holmes emulates Dupin, were transferred to the beginning of \"The Adventure of the Resident Patient\". In some later U.S. editions of the Memoirs, which still omit \"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\", this transfer still appears. reference : Wikipedia, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"}, "108": {"title": "The Return of Sherlock Holmes", "bid": "108", "genre": "detective and mystery", "author": "doyle, arthur conan", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xgnTteuZ694C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "publishDate": "1905", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VHMaAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api", "read_link": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/108/108-h/108-h.htm", "publisher": "Morang & Company", "description": "Description not available..."}, "863": {"title": "The Mysterious Affair at Styles", "bid": "863", "genre": "detective and mystery", "author": "christie, agatha", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z076vbQumjcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "publishDate": "2009-02-19", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AGeKNSDIP38C&dq=The+Mysterious+Affair+at+Styles&hl=&source=gbs_api", "read_link": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/863/863-h/863-h.htm", "publisher": "Random House Digital, Inc.", "description": "When a wealthy, elderly woman is poisoned, Belgian detective Hercule Poirot seeks the murderer among a large group of friends and relatives."}, "1155": {"title": "The Secret Adversary", "bid": "1155", "genre": "detective and mystery", "author": "christie, agatha", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_tMaU9JDfm0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "publishDate": "2009-02-24", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=0tDEQwAACAAJ&dq=The+Secret+Adversary&hl=&source=gbs_api", "read_link": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1155/1155-h/1155-h.htm", "publisher": "empty", "description": "Description not available..."}, "2147": {"title": "The Works of Edgar Allan Poe \u2014 Volume 1", "bid": "2147", "genre": "detective and mystery", "author": "poe, edgar allan", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tCEbAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "publishDate": "1908", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TJMZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "read_link": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2147/2147-h/2147-h.htm", "publisher": "BookRix", "description": "Edgar Allan Poe, an appreciation Life of Poe, by James Russell Lowell Death of Poe, by N.

Who was the man who was rumored to have been kept in prison and treated royally during much of the reign of Louis XIV while being forced to wear an iron mask? Could he possibly have been the twin brother of the Sun King? Like every other serious scholar, intrepid historian Paul Sonnino discounts this theory, instead taking the reader along on his adventures to uncover the truth behind this ancient enigma. Exploring the hidden, squalid side of the lavish court of France, the author uncovers the full spectrum of French society, from humble servants to wealthy merchants to kings and queens. All had self-interested reasons to hold their secrets close until one humble valet named Eustache Dauger was arrested and jailed for decades, simply because he knew too much and opened his mouth at the wrong time. Presenting his dramatic solution to the mystery, Sonnino convincingly shows that no one will be able to tell the story of the man in the iron mask without taking into account the staggering array of evidence he has uncovered over the course of decades."}, "10743": {"title": "Moonfleet", "bid": "10743", "genre": "adventure", "author": "falkner, john meade", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uAV-AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "publishDate": "2019-06-09", "infolink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ax2PHB-qmhQC&source=gbs_api", "read_link": "no link", "publisher": "Penguin UK", "description": "Everyone in the tiny village of Moonfleet lives by the sea one way or another, so it's no surprise when young John Trenchard gets involved in the smuggling trade.

The other is simply a record of events wherein Mr. Quatermain was not personally concerned--a Zulu novel, the story of which was told to him by the hero many years after the tragedy had occurred. But with this we have nothing to do at present. I have often thought (Mr. Quatermain's manuscript begins) that I would set down on paper the events connected with my marriage, and the loss of my most dear wife. Many years have now passed since that event, and to some extent time has softened the old grief, though Heaven knows it is still keen enough. On two or three occasions I have even begun the record. Once I gave it up because the writing of it depressed me beyond bearing, once because I was suddenly called away upon a journey, and the third time because a Kaffir boy found my manuscript convenient for lighting the kitchen fire. But now that I am at leisure here in England, I will make a fourth attempt. If I succeed, the story may serve to interest some one in after years when I am dead and gone; before that I should not wish it to be published.

The body that the man or woman wore, if I understand their theory aright which perhaps I, an ignorant person, do not, was but a kind of sack or fleshly covering containing these different principles. Or mayhap it did not contain them all, but was simply a house as it were, in which they lived from time to time and seldom all together, although one or more of them was present continually, as though to keep the place warmed and aired. This is but a casual illustrative suggestion, for what right have I, Allan Quatermain, out of my little reading and probably erroneous deductions, to form any judgment as to the theories of the old Egyptians? Still these, as I understand them, suffice to furnish me with the text that man is not one, but many, in which connection it may be remembered that often in Scripture he is spoken of as being the home of many demons, seven, I think. Also, to come to another far-off example, the Zulus talk of their witch-doctors as being inhabited by \"a multitude of spirits.\" Anyhow of one thing I am quite sure, we are not always the same. Different personalities actuate us at different times. In one hour passion of this sort or the other is our lord; in another we are reason itself. In one hour we follow the basest appetites; in another we hate them and the spirit arising through our mortal murk shines within or above us like a star. In one hour our desire is to kill and spare not; in another we are filled with the holiest compassion even towards an insect or a snake, and are ready to forgive like a god.

Financialization over the past three decades has created a structure that lacks resilience and supports absurd volumes of trading. The finance sector devotes too little attention to the search for new investment opportunities and the stewardship of existing ones, and far too much to secondary-market dealing in existing assets. Regulation has contributed more to the problems than the solutions. Why? What is finance for? John Kay, with wide practical and academic experience in the world of finance, understands the operation of the financial sector better than most. He believes in good banks and effective asset managers, but good banks and effective asset managers are not what he sees. In a dazzling and revelatory tour of the financial world as it has emerged from the wreckage of the 2008 crisis, Kay does not flinch in his criticism: we do need some of the things that Citigroup and Goldman Sachs do, but we do not need Citigroup and Goldman to do them. And many of the things done by Citigroup and Goldman do not need to be done at all. The finance sector needs to be reminded of its primary purpose: to manage other people's money for the benefit of businesses and households. It is an aberration when the some of the finest mathematical and scientific minds are tasked with devising algorithms for the sole purpose of exploiting the weakness of other algorithms for computerized trading in securities.

Stevenson's short novel, published in 1886, became an instant classic. It was a Gothic horror that originated in a feverish nightmare, whose hallucinatory setting in the murky back streets of London gripped a nation mesmerized by crime and violence. The respectable doctor's mysterious relationship with his disreputable associate is finally revealed in one of the most original and thrilling endings in English literature. In addition to Jekyll and Hyde, this edition also includes a number of short stories and essays written by Stevenson in the 1880s, minor masterpieces of fiction and comment: 'The Body Snatcher', 'Markheim', and 'Olalla' feature grave-robbing, a sinister double, and degeneracy, while 'A Chapter on Dreams' and 'A Gossip on Romance' discuss artistic creation and the 'romance' form. Appendixes provide extracts from contemporary writings on personality disorder, which set Stevenson's tale in its full historical context.

Heute steht \"Der Fall Deruga\" synonym f\u00fcr einen Gesellschaftsroman, der die Gesinnungen, Vorurteile und zeittypischen Marotten in den Zeugenstand ruft und dadurch ein Bild des gesellschaftlichen Klimas der damaligen Zeit zeichnet.

Bis heute ist sie in mehr als sechs Millionen Exemplaren verbreitet und in acht Sprachen \u00fcbersetzt worden. So ist die Erz\u00e4hlung zur \u201eliteraturgeschichtlichen Identit\u00e4t Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoffs geworden\u201c . Der Erstdruck der Novelle erschien in sechzehn Fortsetzungen im \u201eMorgenblatt f\u00fcr gebildete Leser\u201c vom 22. April bis zum 10. Mai 1842. Diese weitverbreitete Zeitschrift erschien t\u00e4glich au\u00dfer sonntags und hatte eine Auflage von etwa 1500 Exemplaren. Das Blatt wurde von der damals in literarischen Kreisen sehr popul\u00e4ren Cotta\u2019schen Verlagsbuchhandlung in T\u00fcbingen herausgegeben. Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff hatte das Werk damals mit dem Titel \u201eEin Sittengem\u00e4lde aus dem gebirgigten Westfalen\u201c \u00fcberschrieben, der Redakteur Hermann Hauff f\u00fcgte den Titel \u201eDie Judenbuche\u201c hinzu. Ebenfalls 1842 fand ein Nachdruck in der Zeitschrift \u201eWestf\u00e4lischer Anzeiger\u201c statt, ehe 1859 dann Levin Sch\u00fccking den Text erstmals als Ganzschrift ver\u00f6ffentlichte. Die bemerkenswerte Rezeptionsgeschichte des Werkes setzte allerdings erst ein, nachdem es 1876 von Paul Heyse und Hermann Kurz in ihre Sammlung \u201eDeutscher Novellenschatz\u201c aufgenommen worden war. Mittlerweile existieren \u00fcber 130 Sekund\u00e4rbeitr\u00e4ge \u00fcber \u201eDie Judenbuche\u201c, so da\u00df es nahezu unm\u00f6glich ist, eine allgemeing\u00fcltige Interpretation des Werkes zu finden oder gar zu erstellen, da jeder Autor von anderen Standpunkten ausgeht. Ich m\u00f6chte mich daher in meiner Hausarbeit auf einige Literaturwissenschaftler als Quellen beschr\u00e4nken (siehe dazu die Angaben zur verwendeten Literatur). Hierbei m\u00f6chte ich vor allem die Hauptthesen von Winfried Freund im Teil der Interpretation verwenden sowie die Hauptthesen von Karl Philipp Moritz zur Erl\u00e4uterung des formalen Aufbaus der Novelle heranziehen. Im meinen abschlie\u00dfenden Bemerkungen werde ich diese Ans\u00e4tze dann miteinander vergleichen und kritisieren.

Kuno, der Sohn des Grafen, liegt krank im Bett und wird von zwei Frauen betreut, von seiner alten Amme und von seiner Stiefmutter, einer g\u00fctigen jungen Frau. Die Amme erz\u00e4hlt ihr, dass es in diesem Schloss nicht nur gute Stiefm\u00fctter hat und sie f\u00e4ngt an zu erz\u00e4hlen: In diesem Schloss lebte einst ein kluger und guter Graf, dessen Frau von allen ,,die gute Gr\u00e4fin\" genannt wurde. Sie war bek\u00fcmmert, weil sie scheinbar keine Kinder bekommen konnte. Als der weise Zauberer Cyprianus verwundet und von Gr\u00e4fin gesund gepflegt wird, entwickelt sich eine Freundschaft zwischen den beiden. Die Gr\u00e4fin erz\u00e4hlt dem Zauberer von ihrem Kummer. Cyprianus schickt ihr nach seiner Abreise einen Spiegel, in den sie immer wieder schauen solle. Sie solle aber wissen, dass sie Gottes Wege nicht umleiten k\u00f6nne und dass der Spiegel niemals eine Bluttat sehen d\u00fcrfe, sonst werde sich das Schicksal gegen die Nachkommen richten. Die Frau sieht von nun an jeden Tag in den Spiegel, und eines Tages sieht sie im Spiegel einen Nebel, aus dem ein Kindergesicht auftaucht. Doch nur ihrem Mann f\u00e4llt auf, dass das Bildnis Kind im Spiegel weint. Bald bringt sie einen Jungen zur Welt, der Kuno genannt wird, so wie der Stiefsohn der sp\u00e4teren Gr\u00e4fin. Bald nach Kunos Geburt stirbt die Mutter an einer Seuche. Die Trauer ist gro\u00df. Einige Jahre sp\u00e4ter beschlie\u00dft der Graf, sich in Wien eine neue Frau zu suchen. Die Frau, die er aus Wien mitbringt, ist wundersch\u00f6n, und jeder, der sie sieht, ist ihrem Zauber verfallen, bis auf Kuno und den klugen Hausmeister. Ein fremder Oberst namens Hager kommt an den Hof, der sich als Vetter des ehemaligen Ehemannes der neuen Gr\u00e4fin ausgibt. Er bleibt am Hof und geht h\u00e4ufig mit dem Grafen auf die Jagd. Doch eines Tages verungl\u00fcckt der Graf bei einer Wildschweinjagd und seine Witwe bleibt die alleinige Herrscherin \u00fcber das Schloss. Inzwischen hat sie einen Sohn geboren, der den Namen Wolf tr\u00e4gt. Die beiden Halbbr\u00fcder lieben einander innig, auch wenn der Oberst immer wieder versucht, einen Keil zwischen beide zu treiben, und die Gr\u00e4fin w\u00fcrde Kuno lieber tot zu sehen. Sie verspricht Hager, Herr \u00fcber das Schloss zu werden, wenn er Kuno umbringt. Aus Zufall t\u00f6tet er Kuno vor dem Spiegel des Cyprianus, und als sein j\u00fcngerer Bruder eines Tages in den Spiegel sieht, entsteht auf seiner Brust der gleiche rote Fleck wie bei seinem Bruder, und er stirbt ebenfalls. Hier endet die Erz\u00e4hlung der alten Amme. Erschrocken stellt die junge Stiefmutter fest, dass die b\u00f6se Gr\u00e4fin aus der Geschichte ihre eigene Vorfahrin ist. Demnach ist auch ihr Stiefsohn Kuno dem Tode geweiht. Doch als der Spiegel als letzte Hoffnung der Amme herangeschafft wird, wird der junge Graf wieder gesund, und er sieht die beiden Knaben Kuno und Wolf l\u00e4chelnd als Engel zum Himmel fliegen. Die junge Gr\u00e4fin aber sieht ein neues Kindergesicht im Nebel auftauchen und beschlie\u00dft, das Kind, falls es ein Junge wird, Wolf zu nennen."}, "21125": {"title": "The Boy Patriot", "bid": "21125", "genre": "adventure", "author": "ellis, edward sylvester", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KNc_AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "publishDate": "1863", "infolink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=GkxwDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Boy+Patriot&hl=&source=gbs_api", "read_link": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21125/21125-h/21125-h.htm", "publisher": "BoD \u2013 Books on Demand", "description": "Reproduction of the original: The Boy Patriot by Edward S.

Notable fiction stories by Ellis include The Steam Man of the Prairies and Seth Jones, or the Captives of the Frontier.Internationally, Edward S. Ellis is probably known best for his Deerfoot novels read widely by young boys until the 1950s Seth Jones was the most significant of early dime novels of publishers Beadle and Adams. During the mid-1880s, after a fiction-writing career of some thirty years, Ellis eventually began composing more serious works of biography, history, and persuasive writing. Of note was \"The Life of Colonel David Crockett,\" which had the story of Davy Crockett giving a speech usually called \"Not Yours To Give.\" It was a speech in opposition to awarding money to a Navy widow on the grounds that Congress had no Constitutional mandate to give charity. It was said to have been inspired by Crockett's meeting with a Horatio Bunce, a much quoted man in Libertarian circles, but one for whom historical evidence is non-existent. It is said that Seth Jones was one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite stories"}, "223": {"title": "The Wisdom of Father Brown", "bid": "223", "genre": "detective", "author": "chesterton, g. k.
